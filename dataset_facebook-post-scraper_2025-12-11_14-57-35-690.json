I know this might sound a bit underhand if maybe u have scratched it but if you're not sure then just leave it. if client them mentions it explain you did notice it but did not mention it astounding were unsure if not already there and 3rd ... have an eye for detail before u start your clean.. ive been here several times before and marks have already been there .. also dont worry ... u will come across all sorts of things / marks that can make you question yourself. in the end uou become used to it. I only ever speak to client if we are 100 per cent we made an error",

  "text": "Hey everyone, I’m currently looking for cleaners to employ on a part time/full time basis. I’ve tried several hiring platforms including indeed, next door, zip recruiter, barefoot students, Craigslist. I do get some applicants but it’s either they don’t show up for interview, they show up but don’t seem like who we can work with, language barrier, or they just drop somewhere in the onboarding process. What do you suggest is the reason? Am I not looking enough? \nThe pay rate is decent for the location so I don’t believe it’s the compensation. Moreover, there’s a lot of benefits with my company.\nAnyone know a good place to find cleaners and what strategies did you implement in your hiring process?",

If they showed up, followed instructions and sent over 3 references, they passed the first screening. Then we moved into interviewing the best possible applicants with phone interviews, zoom interviews and a working interview. If they passed there, we can hire and start training. It's a process. Definitely takes several weeks to find someone suitable.",

Should they clock out once they finish the first home and that starts the 30min break, or drive to where they are eating and then clock out? I hadn't put much thought into it, but with there being so much confusion I want black and white steps for reference. Thank you in advance!",

How did she go from stellar performance to complete bullshit? She even sent me a text message saying that she killed it. I accept full responsibility for this.

We are often giving clients partial refunds, and sometimes we even lose a client or two.

      "text": "I actually just went through this exact situation last Tuesday and had to terminate an employee for the same reason. Our employee handbook outlines everything very clearly — the training/probation period is 90 days, and a detailed review happens at 60 days. Employees cannot have more than two unexcused call-offs within any six-month period. That policy is intentionally in place to filter out unreliable hires early. Frequent call-offs in the first six months always become bigger problems later.\n\nThis employee had already received a written warning on 10/28 when she reached 1 point. When I ran a full report last Monday, she actually had 4.5 points — the admin had not been calculating her late arrivals correctly. That same day, she emailed—after being on the clock for over an hour—saying she was leaving. She had cleaned one small break room at a commercial site and walked out. I terminated her the next day. She was fully aware that attendance was already an issue.\n\nSympathy aside, our business only operates when the work is taken seriously. My commercial accounts expect their spaces to be cleaned when they walk in, and at midnight there’s no one available to cover a last-minute call-off. The timing was unfortunate because we’re entering our busiest season with holidays and Michigan winter weather, but she was simply too unpredictable. She ended up being terminated exactly at her 60-day mark.\n\nMy other two employees are fully scheduled, so I’m the buffer right now — which is challenging because I also handle daytime operations. Finding employees with solid attendance has been one of the biggest hurdles, and honestly I’m likely pausing hiring until the new year to avoid onboarding someone during Christmas break.\n\nMy honest advice:\nRevisit your employee handbook and make sure your attendance policies are clearly outlined, signed, and consistently enforced. If you don’t follow your own policies, employees will walk all over you — not maliciously, but because you’ve shown them there are no real consequences. They are not your friends; they are your employees, and the tone you set early determines how seriously they take the role. Even someone who’s been with you five years will push boundaries if expectations aren’t upheld from the beginning.",

I dropped a client because he told me he wouldn’t be home, but when I tried contacting him to confirm a new clean time because we were running late, he was out of service range. That’s fine, in those cases we just reschedule because I’m not about to get caught in someone’s house at the wrong time. He called me back halfway through when we were supposed to be there and screamed at me. I specifically remember him saying that if I have policies in place for when clients cancel last minute, I better have a policy in place for when WE cancel last minute. This was after I explained to him the policy about not being able to get ahold of him in the first place. I just told him we weren’t a good fit anymore and cancelled his service. He gave me some flack but in the end he said “good luck in business” and that was it",

  "text": "Question for the group\n\nI’m on the hunt for great quality cotton cleaning rags, not the thin, crappy ones most brands sell. I’ve tried several options and none have held up. The last cleaning company I worked for had rags that were absolute workhorses, but I can’t find anything like them.\n\nSo which cotton rags do you use that you actually like?\nDurable, absorbent, lint-free, something that doesn’t make cleansing frustrating lol. Drop brand names or links if you’ve got them.\n\nAlso, bonus question, Has anyone ever used the “Speed Cleaning Training & Certification Program”? I’m curious if it’s worth investing in. Would love to hear real feedback.",

      "text": "I am very alarmed at the number of business owners that recommend to meet with cleaners only once a month or every other month. I was an owner/operator for 8 out of the 12 years that I’ve been in business. This business can be very lonely for our cleaners that work independently on a daily basis. Some are more introverted and don’t mind the non social aspect of the job. It’s my firm belief that the reason our industry experiences such high turnover rates is because our cleaners are not engaged with the team or feeling appreciated. The sole purpose of having weekly meetings with my team is to bring everyone together, bring them breakfast and just talk to them like they are human and not work horses for our company. Can a business still be profitable paying for an hour of our cleaners time to sit and learn and get to know one another on a better level, absolutely. Thank you for those that offered your ideas on what to train on. And no, we don’t just train every week. Sometimes we just come together and share a meal together that I provide.",

  "text": "So today I had a difficult situation for a cleaner. They were doing a clean for a 50 year old male that said they were disabled. They arrived and got to work. However, then things started to get weird. The client said some strange things:\n1) he said he was going to leave a $500 tip,\n2) he said he was very lonely,\n3) he said his previous cleaner used to sleep with him\n4) he then walked to the toilet in his boxer shorts (so not disabled)\n3) he asked the cleaner when last she had kissed someone, she said she had a fiance, to which he replied, 'that is not what I asked'. \n\nAt this point the cleaner said she had an emergency and left the property. \n\nShe called me up hyperventilating and explained what had happened and that she felt very vulnerable. We calmed her down, did a full debrief and asked if she wanted to report the incident to the authorities - she did not want to. We have written to the client advising we are terminating services due to 'conduct during the service which made it unable to safely continue'. We're also creating a policy to ensure this never happens again. Unfortunately though there is no way to 100% screen against this.\n\nI am asking for any input on what you do to protect staff. Our cleaners work solo but I'm considering either insisting on having crews work in pairs where a solo male client is home. Is it appropriate to ask clients who will be home during the clean? Really trying to understand the best way to handle this as it is a first for me.",

      "text": "Sorry to hear about that. Everyone usually has at least one incident of that “creepy,” client. But overall in your business life cycle it should be uncommon. But it’s good to have a policy in place like you are looking for. Your policy should be if a client, male or female makes you uncomfortable, leave. Teach your cleaner to use the excuse of, “I’m so sorry, I’ve been informed I need to go as I’m needed elsewhere.” It’s vague, urgent, and isn’t untruthful. Then the cleaner, once safely in their vehicle and away from the property can report and checkin with the office. Make it a standard procedure, discuss, and role play it. Luckily, should rarely occur. We also have a policy that if any cleaner doesn’t want to clean for a certain client we won’t make them go back or make them explain. I think those 2 procedures are what you need to make it work effectively. As for the offending client, keep it short and sweet and explain we aren’t a good fit.",

  "text": "Hi everyone!\nI see a lot of people asking how to find new clients or real leads, so I figured I’d share what’s been working for me—especially on the commercial side.\n\nI’ve been working with someone for almost a year now who runs my lead campaigns and helps me manage the follow-ups, it’s honestly made such a difference. One thing I really like is that he only works with one company per industry in each area, so as a cleaning business in Westchester County, I’m not competing with five other cleaners using the same service. He also actually puts in the work—he sends me the leads, checks in to make sure I’m following up, and keeps me on track when I need that nudge.\n\nWe also do bi-weekly video calls where he goes over what’s working, what needs adjusting, and how the campaigns are doing. He set me up with tools to track everything, which helped a lot because I don’t think I would’ve stepped into commercial cleaning as confidently without all the support. He does residential and commercial campaigns, but I only use him for commercial since my residential fills up through word of mouth and Google reviews.\n\nHe’s affordable, effective, and the clients I got from him have turned into long-term accounts. If anyone wants his info, I’m happy to share it privately. \n\nI’m based in Westchester County, NY if that helps!",

For construction cleans it’s about cleaning it in layers because the dust will continue to get stirred up and then settle back down to the floors and surfaces.  I would have two good backpack vacuums for commercial.  Once you have the proper supplies you just learn as you go.  Make sure you are hitting all of the areas that the client is concerned with and you are good 😊",

  "text": "How are we handling dishes? We charge flat and pay flat rate so it’s a variable that is throwing kinks into our flow. When I was solo, I always happily did the dishes whether loaded in dishwasher or hand washed, no questions asked. 98% of clients don’t leave any or many dishes and a few have a sink full(usually busy families, and I GET IT!). But I’ve had many cleaners get very disgruntled over being asked to do dishes, so we changed the policy to this: \n\n1. Check the dishwasher: If there’s room and dishes are clearly dirty, load what you can.\n\nIf it’s full of clean dishes, do not unload — just skip.\n\n2. Use your judgment: If it’s just a few dishes(10 or less) do a quick hand wash and leave them to dry on a towel or rack.\n\nIf it’s a full sink or the dishes are old or grimy, skip it — we don’t expect you to scrub heavy buildup or pots and pans.\n\n3. Clean the sink area regardless: Move dishes aside, clean the sink, faucet, and counters, then replace them neatly.\n\n4. Snap a photo and leave a note in ZenMaid\n\nExample:\n“Sink was full of dishes. I wiped around the area but skipped washing. See attached photo.”\n\nThis is not working because “use your judgement” = inconsistency and some cleaners are skipping this 2 minute task. So I’m wanting to hear some other “dish policies” to see if I’m asking too much of them.",

We will wash the dishes which may result in something else not getting done. This puts the ball in their court with clear understanding of what happens if they don’t tidy up. I do not tolerate scope creep at all and this helps them understand they cannot expect extra work without additional compensation. Mostly the clients who consistently leave dishes are grateful for our willingness to do dishes.",

I have never been able to balance jobs and cleaners.\n\nScheduling has been an ongoing problem with cleaners complaining that the schedule changes too often, and they don't see a week in advance because it changes often.  As soon as they see an open morning or afternoon, they make plans, dr appointment, etc.  So if we try to put in a new deep clean, we have a difficult time getting a team together.  How does everyone else handle this?  I've been in business for going on 8 years, and it's still a problem.  The seasonality of coastal Florida doesn't help!  Thanks for any advice.",

Before the start of each week, they tell us what days and hours they'd be willing to work, before we assign them to any cleaning schedule. And once they tell us, we assign their cleaning jobs to match their availability, to which it's much easier for them to commit to showing up and doing amazingly. Cleaners are less likely to leave you hanging if you give them the flexibility that they need and that's something that most work places don't even practice or do. Many comments say how strict they are but it doesn't have to be that way, at least that's what we found out and this method of them choosing their own flexible schedules works well for us.",

Which is insane. \n\nSo I'm stealing a game format I saw somewhere and making it cleaning-business themed.\n\nHere's how it works: introduce yourself but make it interesting. Give us your name, where you're at, what you do, and then **two truths and one lie** about your cleaning business journey.\n\nI'll go first so you can see what I mean:\n\n**Chris | Yokohama, Japan**\nLong-time remote cleaning business owner, now I coach others go remote and hire great VAs. \n\n**My two truths and a lie:**\n1. A client once asked if we could clean during their Zoom meetings because we're \"that quiet\" (I was so confused)\n2. I did a sales call at 2am in my pajamas because a client could \"only talk at 1pm EST\" (timezones are hell)\n3. I approved a $5K equipment purchase via voice message while hiking Mount Fuji (seemed like a good idea at the time?)\n\n**Guess which one is BS 👇**\n\nAlright, your turn. Copy the format or just wing it, I don't care. The point is let's actually meet each other.\n\nThrow yours in the comments. Try to guess other people's lies. Tag someone you've been wondering about but never talked to.\n\nThis should be fun!",

My other thought - I'm not sure on this - would be if you as the owner mentioned you received a complaint, I wonder if the 1099 would ask what your suggestions are? I know as an owner, I couldn't give unsolicited advice, because that could look like direction and then they'd be classified as a W-2 employee. We don't want that to happen! But for W-2 employees, this is what I'm buying and what I want you to use. You could ask a couple of W-2's if they would trial it and give feedback before you bought a bunch of cleaner. I think Stephanie Pipkin does that with her company.",

This is the first time we have had a team member as a lead for 2 years that consistently crushes it, but they have hit a ceiling and we would like to delegate more responsibilities to this individual for additional compensation. \n\n* What are the typical roles and duties performed by team members in your leadership?\n* What incentives were integrated into their compensation structure to ensure accountability and performance was kept up?\n* Did you delegate financials such as payroll and budget , or is this still one of your primary areas as the owner?\n* What strategies were used when developing these positions for your company?",

I also have someone that helps with social media posts, blogs and email blasts. There is one more who is stepping up for inventory even though we haven’t officially invited her to the job yet. But about once a week she asks if anything has been delivered that she can take to the storage unit and then makes a count on other items that are needed.

  "text": "# Hello! This was sent to me last night by a commercial client of mine. The unit I clean has 6 offices rented by different businesses. I don't clean the individual offices, just common areas. The tenants leave their garbage outside their door to be collected over the weekend.  They sometimes leave all kinds of stuff to be thrown out... medical supplies, office supplies, books, etc. The box she's referring to was on the floor right next to the garbage bag, no note saying \"donation\". I assumed it was garbage and in the dumpster it went. I told my client what happened and that I would see if it was still there. I felt bad that it was a donation, so I went with gloves and flashlight, ready to do some dumpster diving 😂But it had already been emptied. To be clear, I don't feel I did anything wrong, if she takes donations after hours she should have a better system set up so something like this doesn't happen. But her heading the email \"Items Taken\" and saying \"the cleaning company must have taken it\" (instead of the cleaning company may have tossed it) is a red flag to me. I was going to offer to reach out to her personally but with the tone of that email my gut said stay away! lol I texted my client that the box is gone, I assumed it was garbage, I'm sorry for the mix up and I will only remove equipment by her door that is marked as trash going forward. \n# Thoughts or comments? Did I handle this correctly? And if she makes a stink about this (like saying I owe her whatever was in the box) what is the best way to handle it? Thanks for any input :)",

  "text": "**VA Prep Bootcamp Update for Zenmaiders:**\n\nAfter placing hundreds of VAs for cleaning business owners, I can spot who's ready and who's not in about 30 seconds.\n\nHere are the 3 Signs You're NOT Ready to Hire a VA yet:\n\n🚫 **Sign #1: \"I'll figure out what to delegate after I hire them\"** Reality: They'll sit around confused while you scramble to create work\n\n🚫 **Sign #2: \"I need someone to just take stuff off my plate\"** Reality: Without clear processes, they can't take anything effectively\n\n🚫 **Sign #3: \"I don't have time to train them properly\"** \n\nReality: Then you don't have time to hire them. Training IS the investment\n\nIn all honesty if you're not ready to prepare properly, you're not ready to hire.\n\nMost VA agencies will happily sell you a VA TODAY, whether you're ready or not. They get paid either way. But when it fails in 30 days, that's your problem.\n\nMy approach is different: I help you hit specific benchmarks that PROVE you're ready before you spend a dollar on hiring.\n\nThat's what the** FREE VA Bootcamp (Dec 8-9th)** is all about - getting you actually ready BEFORE you waste money on a hire that won't work.\n\nWhich sign hit closest to home? Comment 1, 2, or 3 below and I'll send you an invite👇",

I am very detailed and carry a good amount of supplies so I prefer rolling caddy to save my back.... but will be moving to Ohio in the next year or two and plan is to open a new business there and start scaling. I've whittled down the tool/supply list as much as I can but still feel like an over the shoulder caddy would be a little heavy for them.... However also don't want them having to roll a caddy through leaves and snow. The rolling caddy I currently have doesn't have a strap. Maybe I should just buy them a rolling caddy with removable dolly and a shoulder strap?? 🤔 Thoughts?",

Training takes longer than expected, but that's normal, right?\n**Week 2**: The VA keeps asking questions. Lots of questions.

Something feels wrong.\n**Week 4**: A customer calls you directly, frustrated. \"Your VA told me the wrong information.\" You check the messages...they're all over the place. Nothing is how you'd do it.\n\nNow you're stressed, the VA is confused, and you've spent $2,000+ for... what exactly?\n\n**So what went wrong?**\n\nThe VA wasn't bad. You just weren't ready.\n\nYou were missing the 3 things that make VA relationships actually work:\n\n1. **Documented processes** - The VA was guessing at how you wanted things done\n2. **Clear role definition** - \"Help with the business\" isn't a job description\n3.** Communication systems** - You were both winging it daily\n\nThe mistake wasn't hiring a VA.\n\nThe mistake was hiring BEFORE you were prepared.\n\nThis is exactly what we're fixing in the FREE VA Prep Bootcamp (Dec 8-9th).\n\nWe'll build those 3 things together BEFORE you waste another dollar on a confused hire.\n\n**Has this happened to you?

There are many apps that will log your driving for you.\n\nYou can choose standard deduction for the business miles driven or actual vehicle expenses for the percentage of business miles driven.\n\nIf you have any questions about app recommendations, which deduction method to choose, or need any other bookkeeping advice we're happy to help answer them. My wife Amber's Bookkeeping company handles all our records and tax deductions and the CPA always says he wishes all his clients had records like ours 😁\n\nIt's a good time of the year for you to ask, so you can get all your records up to date and ready for 2025 Tax filing 😁",

If you’re using the products from Amway you’re saving a ton of money compared to buying bottles of premixed solutions from HD, Walmart, Amazon, etc. However if you compared the diluted versions to what local janitorial suppliers offer, you might end up spending more.

If you file as an scorp you have to pay yourself a reasonable salary (payroll) with payroll taxes paid. \nWhen you pay yourself hourly are you paying taxes or just taking out your hourly wage then doing taxes at yearend?\nYour percentages are based on real revenue. Real revenue would be after cost. Your labor is the cost. You'd take your sales minus labor then % to owners draw. If you don't remove your labor before your percent i would say do the % pay yourself and owners draw the difference. Many do the draw quarterly or year end. \nThis is an amazing book and system.",

They say they are happy with my service, even books me again, and they say they will leave a review when I sent them the Google Revie page, but they dont leave a review. Ugh. \nWhat if I add in the thank you card, \" leave us a review on google and get 20% off \" or even a free hour of cleaning. \n\nMy business is new and I need reviews. I only have 10. \n\nThoughts?",

      "text": "Way off. Our production rate for medical is 2000-2500 sqft per hour per person. So I’m at 6 hours total. If the two locations are any significant distance per a drive, like 15 minutes or more, I’d add in that time too, assuming the same person is cleaning both. \n\nThe above also assumes that this is basic medical cleaning and not terminal or aseptic cleaning. \n\nSo at 6 hrs at 5 days paying $20/hr, and assuming a 15% labor tax rate for an employee, I’m paying in labor $35,880/yr. My supplies would assume that I want to keep supplies and equipment at each location. Assuming an average SOW and due to being small, I’m at $800/yr for each. Finally, I don’t know your P&L or profit goals but if I aim for a 33% gross profit, that’s $18,740/yr going into my and my company’s pocket. \n\nAdd them up and I get $56,220/yr or $4685/mo for both. \n\nIf he wants the 4300 sqft location, In lieu of redoing my math I’d factor in a percentage. 4300 is 35.4% of both spaces. My price would be approx $1659/mo for that space. Based on your price it’s $3575/mo.",

  "text": "Seeking Guidance: Growing from Solo to LLC \n\n​Hello everyone! I'm reaching out to this knowledgeable community for a little guidance as I navigate the next phase of my cleaning business, Thrive & Shine Maids.\n\n​I've been working as a solo cleaner for a year, and recently, I took the leap: I brought on my first independent contractor a few months ago and have just finalized the switch to an LLC structure.\n​I'm now in that tricky spot between being a one person show and becoming a true business owner. \n\nWould anyone further along than me be willing to answer a nice list of questions for me? I just ask for you to answer whatever you're comfortable with and at your convenience. Even one solid piece of advice is incredibly helpful!\n\nIf you interact with my post, I will send over my questions! Would also love to make a new friend or possibly a mentor! Thanks everyone ☺️",

  "text": "What do you say to a customer that booked a deep clean, 900 Sqft house & partial basement. \n2 girls were there for 5 hours, so 10 labor hours of work. \nA lot was done, and the customer recognizes they did amazing work in some areas. But at the same time, she's sending me videos of a paper towel test on her flooring (towel is lightly brown) , there was 1 hair she took a very close up photo on the outside of her tub, and just  little , very petty things. \nShe then says she will not be using us anymore for bi-weekly service. Fine. \nBut She said she had to \"go over things\" after they left, but at the same time very satisfied with overall 80% of their work done.  \nIs she being unreasonable for nitpicking failing a clean paper towel on mopped floors for a deep cleaning? She does have dogs in the home. \nShe also said she expected them to only be there for 2.5-3 hours that her house had no stuck grime or dust etc \"it wasn't even that bad\" so she doesn't even want to pay for the 10 Labor hours of work.",

Pets will get floors dirty quickly with dirt they track in and dander they drop, so that paper towel test doesn't apply. I live in the desert and dust drifts in and settles on everything five minutes after I've dusted or mopped floors.",

If you’d like to continue adding extras like pick up and dishes it will be xxx additional each service as this adds considerable time on to each cleaning. If you’d like to change sheets ($5 extra per bed) please have the clean sheets out and ready to be changed. Thanks so much!",

The client left during the cleaning, and we later noticed the damage after she had already gone. Nothing was said or mentioned before she left.\n\nI’ve already sent the client a polite message to address it, but now I’m unsure what to do next — should my employee stay at the property or go ahead and leave? I just want to make sure we’re handling this the right way and documenting everything properly.\n\nHas anyone else had this happen before? How did you handle it?",

  "text": "Hope everyone is having a wonderful week! I’d love to get anyone’s input that has cleaned in a restaurant setting before. We handle plenty of commercial spaces, but this will be our first restaurant. Please note we will not be doing anything in the kitchen area whatsoever. Our only scope will be floors in the main portion of the restaurant and doing the bathrooms. Simple and straight forward. Thank god haha.\n\nBathrooms we know, but handling the floors here is what I’m new to. We got about 3,100 sqft of tile floors to handle\n\nWhat I’m looking for from you restaurant cleaning pros out there!\n1. What would you estimate to be your production rate for floors? Keep in mind there are chairs lots of chairs.\n2. Do you have your tech place chairs on top of tables or simply move them?\n3. What are your go to products for this type of setting? Clearly we need a floor cleaner that is a degreaser…?\n4. What equipment do you prefer? Are you using an auto scrubber? Flat mop system with a charging bucket? Or traditional style?\n\nIf you’ve handled cleaning for a restaurant I’d love your input. Thank you!",

  "text": "-Needing help with commercial/medical office and clinic bids and pricing.  \n\nHello all!  This is my first post in the group, but I have been soaking up all the knowledge from this fabulous group since my partner and I started in February of this year.  Our business has grown much faster than we ever anticipated and is continuing to grow in residential, commercial, and post-construction clients.  We currently have around 35 recurring clients with $14k in revenue monthly with 5 part time cleaners and 1 part time admin.  Zenmaid has been a huge part of what has helped us stand out among other cleaning services.  So, I’m thankful for having discovered the program and the resources that have come with it!  We are  beginning to experience more growth on our commercial side but find we are struggling with pricing.  Our typical residential rates are not based on an hourly rate or square footage but sort of a hybrid pricing model while our post-construction is strictly based on square footage.  With commercial clients, especially medical offices and clinics, we are still trying to nail down our method for pricing.  We do not want to use straight hourly rates but find there is a big range between the low/high end on square footage rates in this area.  We are currently bidding on 2 separate commercial locations.  One is a 4300 sq ft medical wellness spa & clinic with 10 hybrid exam/counseling/aesthetic rooms and 8 offices and a spa room.  The other is a 4000 sq ft IT space with around 30 offices.  The facilities are similar in size but entirely different in set up.  Does anyone have a suggestion or be willing to share their method for pricing commercial buildings?  Any insight and info is appreciated!",

      "text": "You’re missing a lot of info, it’s ok, we all start somewhere. \n\nThe thing you need to zero in on is production rate. There’s a huge variance in commercial that doesn’t exist in residential. Residential rates might be 500-1000 sqft/hr\n\nI have some commercial accounts I expect 4,000-5,000 sqft/hour. \n\nThe amount of people, flooring type, all play a part.\n\nWithout more info, I’d say your 4,300 sq wellness spa is 2-3 hours. The 4k is probably closer to 1.5-2.\n\nOther factors- how often are they being cleaned? If it’s nightly, you can definitely shorten these times, if it’s weekly or more, you probably need to lengthen it.",

  "text": "Good Morning! \n\nWhat do y’all do when a client has been pet free then adds dog (puppy) into the mix? My gut is to obviously charge more now as there will be added debris but I’ve not experienced this yet. \nDo you go off of an additional fee? \nOr simply add extra time and adjust payment?\n\n**AND - what is your verbiage around communicating this to your client. She’s already been bothered that I’ve raised prices to be at a proper COGS so I know this will be triggering to her. Chat gpt will probably assist me but wanted to see what your experience is with this.\n\nThank you!",

Lol but the extra for me only really comes in when I am quoting for a deep cleaning (dogs rubbing against the walls and transferring mud, the wall and baseboards by the food bowls, etc) but for my standard cleanings, my vacuum and tools were great for keeping any fur up quickly. I started posting cute pics of my customer's pets and putting funny captions titled \"employee of the week.\" And my customers always end up sharing the post of their fur babies on their own page and its brought me a ton of money in referrals that way! (Think free advertising every time they share the post to their page)",

One thing I still struggle with is turning one-time or first-time clients into recurring clients (weekly, biweekly, or monthly).\n\nWe deliver great service and get awesome feedback — but many clients still don’t commit to an ongoing plan after the initial cleaning.\n\nWhat are your best practices or strategies that help you sell and retain recurring cleanings after the first visit?\n\nDo you offer incentives, membership plans, follow-up scripts, or something else that works well for you?\n\nWould love to hear how you all approach it 🙏",

In fact I have at least half of my clients booking us multiple times per week. I don’t offer discounts. If you take away the option, then you only work with clients who are looking for a recurring service 😊",

      "text": "Use Dialpad.\n\nI have used Zoom Phone, Quo (formerly OpenPhone), and Dialpad professionally.\n\nZoom has excellent call quality, but so many frustrations. For example, you can't have a phone menu (\"If you're a new customer, press 1...\") and send text messages from the same number. You literally need to have two phone numbers-- a main line, and a texting line-- to make this possible. It's full of this kind of friction. It's an afterthought in Zoom's product offerings and it shows.\n\nQuo (OpenPhone) has a wonderful app and good integrations, BUT the call quality is terrible if you're not on WiFi. If you live in a major city with seamless 5G coverage or the phone will only be used by office staff, it can be OK.\n\nDialpad has a well-designed app and good integrations AND they solved the call quality problem. In areas with low data (5G) coverage, Dialpad uses your phone's cell service for phone calls. Overall, this is the winner.\n\nFYI I don't have a \"use my code!\" for Dialpad or anything. This has just been a multi-year odyssey for me lol.",

She keeps my books for me, taxes straight, figures out my sales tax and files my business and personal taxes at the end. If you are interested I can send you her info. We also have quarterly meetings to go over my books. (Virtually)\nI use travelers for workers comp in Pa and we are signed up for pay as you go. At the end of the week you enter your payroll and it tells you what you owe. The audit comes out to zero at the end of the year. I was\nBurned MANY times w that. Liability is also based on your payroll so be careful w that as well.  I’ve dealt w a couple of shady agents in the past and I didn’t fully understand the insurance and was entirely too trusting. My accountant does my insurance audit at the end of the year. \nI also use a small local payroll company so they deal w all of the payroll taxes and all of that. \nLastly, make sure your subcontractors have their own insurance and are actually subcontractors and not employees. An accountant can help you to properly classify. \nGood luck to you- it seems overwhelming but once you hire an accountant to figure all of this out- you can get back to growing your company without all of this worry.",

They are all more than capable of checking each other's work.  The part they are uncomfortable with is the conversation at the end where they let the cleaner know about anything they found that was missed.  \n\nCan you share the worksheet or online survey you have them use for checking each other and more about what the interaction looks like between the check-er and the check-ee?  \n\nWe have a good team and positive culture and I really want to empower them to be able to do quality checks on each other and just make it a normal part of what we do.  But as of right now I'm worried they would overlook or not report things that were missed bc they are uncomfortable with the conversations.  \n\nOur current team is great so anything missed would likely be minor although that may not always be the case as we add more team members.\n\nStephanie Pipkin",

  "text": "✨ Looking for a little advice from fellow cleaners or business owners! ✨\nRight now, most of my work is focused on Airbnb cleanings, but I’ve noticed our area is becoming pretty saturated, and bookings have started to slow down. Because of that, I’m thinking about transitioning more into residential cleaning — but I’m not quite sure the best way to go about it.\nFor my Airbnb clients, I’ve always charged a flat rate, which works really well. But with residential cleanings, I know every home and client’s needs can vary a lot, which makes me wonder if an hourly rate might make more sense.\nFor those of you who do residential work — what’s worked best for you? Flat rate or hourly? And any tips on transitioning from Airbnb to residential?\nAppreciate any advice or insight! 💙",

      "text": "We do flat rate based on our production rate and an estimated time it will take to complete the job. Ask 5000 questions then ask more😂 \n\nI suggest charging hourly until you know your production rate so that you don’t get stuck at a 12 -14 hour job that you quoted flat rate at $325. \n\nCreate client guidelines and have them sign them before you ever step foot in their property. \n\nUse checklist for your client to see what you’re going to do and for you/your cleaners to follow. \n\nUp your communication - residential clients tend to like more communication than other clients. \n\nAutomate your scheduling so there is no double booking or over booking. \n\nAllow extra time in your estimates until you get a good rhythm/flow and until you know your production rate. \n\nDecide what task you are\nWilling to do and what you aren’t. Some examples: are you willing to do dishes (spell it out exactly what you’re willing to do whether it’s only put away or load and start the dishwasher or if you’re willing to do two sinks plus a countertop full of dirty dishes), laundry (fold and put away only or wash dry fold and put away or stain treatments, sorting). \nAre you willing to clean litter boxes or pick up animal feces/ clean up urine?\nWhat will you bring and what does the client need to supply? \nWill you use your vacuum on flooring that has been soiled by pets? \nAre you comfortable cleaning with pets and humans home? \n\nDo you have any allergies to things people often have in their home? \n\nWhatever you answer is to all of these - go make a guideline about it bc the client will need you to spell it out for them. It protects you when you have boundaries in place. Things go much smoother when you have a clear idea of what you’re walking into.",

  "text": "Need some advice, cleaners!\nI have a client who is the mother of a family friend. She normally pays a flat $120 for her clean, which is usually about 3 hours. This week, they had the area rugs from 3 rooms sent out for cleaning, which left the floors bare with lots of residue from the rug backing. I had to vacuum and mop multiple times where I normally just vacuum.\n\nOn top of that, she had used rug tape to hold them in place. She pulled up the tape in the foyer and asked me to get the sticky off. I told her I wasn’t prepared for that type of job and didn’t have the right supplies (like Goo Gone). She was upset and asked me to try anyway. I had a green Scotch-Brite pad, so I used that on the tile and it worked. Once she saw that, she started pulling tape up in the other rooms and said, “Great, you can do these rooms too.”\n\nThat turned into an extra 1.5 hours of scrubbing floors. She still paid me the regular $120 since I don’t charge hourly, I charge per job. Honestly, if I had known in advance, this would have been at least a $180 job.\n\nWhat should I have done or said differently in this situation? Would you have stopped and set a new price before continuing? How do you handle things like this when you’re put on the spot?",

  "text": "Interested in peoples views.  It seems US business is primed for growth but in the UK growth is not welcomed by our government AT ALL , in fact you are penalised so much millions of businesses purposely limit their growth to stay under the VAT threshold ( Its a tax at 20% of revenue that annihilates customer facing businesses). I asked Chat to run a comparable of my company and it said : Do you want me to also run a **direct UK vs US side-by-side table** so you can clearly see how profits diverge as you scale? That way you’ll see exactly how VAT in the UK eats into growth vs US payroll tax structure.\n\nEntrepreneurs are leaving the UK in droves, we have the biggest exodus on the planet second only to China, 9,500 left in the last year. I'm thinking I may have to leave the UK altogether if I want to be able to grow a business. Its so disheartening to know your government actively doesn't want businesses to grow or take on staff as the bottleneck at the threshold has just been growing into the millions for years..... the government must know about it and see that that tax is a huge barrier to growth. Which suggests its a purposeful barrier. What are your thoughts? If you are in a different country is there a blocker to your growth by the government ?",

      "text": "I'm British-American and grew up in both countries, so this speaks directly to me as an entrepreneur. I've thought many times about starting a business back in blighty, but it's just extremely unappealing when you have access to the US market already. In fact I briefly ran a software company there, but it was just unnecessarily difficult to meet all the local regs and it didn't work out in part because of the different business climate (not only that, but it really played a role). \n\nYou can make it work and it's still a great place to start a business compared to most countries, but it's not a great place to grow a business profitably. You'll also only get access to a fraction of the funding that a US startup will have access to if you go the funding route.",

Your cleaning is set for a certain amount of time we are not going to be there all day working around you\n\n4) Clear out...if you want to be home don't expect us to clean with you in the room...go to another part of the house and give us some space..and do not follow me around and watch me...I will let you know very quickly I will not clean that way\n\n5) check people: if you have regular service, you are home, you pay by check don't wait til we say \"ok, we are finished\" to write that dang check...have it ready to go\n\nI could go on and on but I won't...what drives yall nuts?",

I then went back into the kitchen to a complete mess while i was in the bedroom they started making apple sauce out of the crab apples. she asked me to do the kitchen floor before i left so i had to do them around her and her child. anyways long story short i left feeling like i did nothing. \n\nidk if this was a rant or not but what would you do?",

As you can see I have ADORABLE 6 year boy child and a supportive husband who gives me the push I need when I feel like I’m failing. If yall have any advice for advertising, along with any advice in  general especially about book keeping I’d greatly appreciate it. I’ve asked a few people, and none of the few people honestly know themselves. This is a new big adventure for myself and family, and I truly want to succeed. I want to show my older children, that yes even if you had a rough past/life that we are capable of turning our lives around and breaking old cycles, and making something of ourselves. That it is never too late to chase a dream, and most importantly, when we start something (like I have with my small business) you don’t give up on it because it gets a bit difficult. With that being said one of my difficulties is asking for help/advice, but I’m realizing now that if I don’t reach out I won’t be able to succeed. Thank you for your time, I hope to hear y’all’s input soon, and look forward to learning some new skills and techniques. ☺️",

Pre-screening is great and we of course block out the no-shows as well. I’ve developed a very strong list of interview questions using ChatGPT that seemed to weed out the knuckleheads. We also have great trainers that are able to spot red flags and call them out to us on day one so we don’t waste our time.

With that said, we get move outs thrown to us often with a days notice, sometimes if its a slow day we can do them that afternoon. \nBut when i add these apartments (2b/1b) my cleaners are livid. The indeed ad said 8-5p Monday-Friday. \n\nEx: yesterday it was a very slow day due to a cancel. This company messaged me tuesday night so i added an apt in the morning... the attitude i was given about it from the cleaners was insane. BUT they were going to be off work around 12pm otherwise... do i have a right to add things? How do you all go about this? Im tired of getting attitudes especially when this was clearly stated in job ads & new hire paperwork that things can be added if completion is before hours on their availability.",

I pay hourly and i just cannot pay these travel times! \n\nThis morning a travel that is 6.7 miles thru back roads, typically takes 10 minutes.. took 47 minutes! We do not live in a huge city with crazy traffic at 10am on country roads. It makes no sense.",

I just registered my cleaning business in Jamaica and I'm so focus on Zenmaid being our CRM software. \n\nDoes anyone know if I'll be able to accept card payments through Zenmaid using Jamaican bank cards or any info accepting payment in Jamaica using Zenmaid at all would be a HUGE help.

I’ve hired an accountant as we have gotten big enough that I need a clear financial plan.\n\nI’m old school and like to handle all things myself and an excel spreadsheet, but I realize I need to get with the times.\n\nI am currently invoicing through Zenmaid, funds collect in square space, and then I transfer funds over to Quickbooks.\n\nI’m wondering if I can invoice through Zenmaid and it go through quickbooks and cut out square space or any other credit card companies .\n(So invoice and funds collct straight to QB) \n\nAlso, does anyone use the invoicing system that is set up to go out automatically? \n\nLooking to streamline it to make it flow, but I’m nervous that it won’t be in my control .\n\nThanks so much in advance for helping this weary and novice business owner !",

I can't remember what countries everyone I interviewed were located in, but I am really grateful I used an agency as it cut through all the overwhelm. One tip, request candidates submit a Loom answering some questions you choose and tell about themselves, this will allow you to only interview the ones you are really interested in and get a feel for personality and communication ability.",

But that been said I have and always had an awesome relationship with my sister and mostly it work because we truly wished the best for each other.

  "text": "Hello everyone, just wondering if you can give me sample bid showing how you would calculate labour, hours, and services for a facility of this size maybe just roughly just an idea hehe thank you very much 😊 the supplies and equipment not included \n\nThe gallery is an 86,000 sq. ft. facility with 32,000 sq. ft. of exhibition space over three floors, including offices, storage, Shop, a 150-seat theatre, and event spaces.\n\n    •    Daily cleaning (5 days/week): Sweeping, vacuuming, mopping, dusting, restroom care, trash/recycling removal, and interior glass cleaning.\n    •    One day deep cleaning (gallery closed): Exhibition areas, offices, classrooms, basement floor polishing (monthly), carpet washing (monthly), and detailed high-traffic area care.\n    •    Office cleaning: 4th floor (~20–30 desks)\n    •    Storage cleaning: Separate building (~5 mins away), ~10 hrs/month\n\nCleaning would be performed 9 AM–3 PM with 2–3 staff.\n\nSo maybe 514 hours total monthly just estimate",

      "text": "I'm commercial only and there's not enough info to come up with a price. But speaking in generalities....\n\nIf I had an 86K gallery, I'd start by asking why they want daytime. There are people there viewing whatever....doing a full clean in the daytime would limit that experience. Plus once you clean, then it's dirty again by the end of the day. Are they looking for a porter service maybe? \n\nIf indeed they want janitorial, then I'd narrow down that time. You're guessing 12-18 hours. That's a really broad range. You'd want to nail that down to your best guess based on your experiences and production rate.\n\nOur production rate for a museum is 4000 sqft per hour per person. but that's vacuuming, restrooms, cleaning display glass, etc. That would place it to 22 hours rounded up. That's far cry from 12-18. But I also suspect you saw it already and have more details than my guess.\n\nI'd then calculate my labor. I'd take the hours and multiply that by days per week, weeks per year, and the rate I want to pay to come up with a gross wage. I'd then multiply that by my labor tax rate. \n\nI never let my clients provide supplies or equipment and I'd budget $1500/yr for the main building and $500/yr on the offsite. This would get me a vacuum at each location, mop bucket at each location, and chemicals for each...so this way I'm not moving things around.\n\nFinally, after I added labor and supplies together, I'd factor in a gross profit (overhead + net profit). If I had a goal of 33% GP, I'd multiply my labor and supplies by 1.5 to get a total contract amount. I'd divide by 12 for a monthly rate.",

Your quote will be different, depending on your revenue, state, zip, payroll, number of employees, etc.\n\nAs an example, I chose a minimal 300K coverage. These prices assume that you will pay for a year in advance (one payment). \n\nPer year:\n\nNext 300K/300K: $1263 \n\nHiscox 300K/300K: $2500\n\nBiberk 300K/600K: $2500  \n\nHartford 300K/600K: $899.00 \n\nHope this info is helpful to someone here.

Large house. Great neighborhood. LESSON LEARNED!\nBeen MEANING to get Steph's on boarding paperwork but hadn't. DANG IT! \n******************************************\nFinally got 🔥BURNED🔥😭22+hour Move-in clean.  Homeowner had verbally agreed to the per manhour price but when she got her invoice said....\"no I'm not paying that much, I'll pay you X amount which is a more fair price\".  \n\n*Time to buy onboarding paperwork from Stephanie Pipkin! *\n\nWhen we initially arrived I told her everything we do in a move-in clean (literally everything but the ceilings) and she agreed. She was there ALL. DAY. LONG. watching all the work that was being done then only offered to pay half. She then sent me screenshots from facebook of people offering deep cleans for $150 - as if ANY size home would be that much.... hers was 3400+q ft   -LOTS of dirty  blinds. She also called the Realty company - or likely her realtor- who said a home that size had been done recently for half what I was charging  (middle TN $45/manhour is my rate which I receive every day except from a few legacy clients). Whoever she spoke with is obviously not a cleaner and has no idea that scope of work can vary / dirt level etc can affect cleaning time and therefore pricing. Sigh.... I still haven't received any payment.",

Im not set yet with either doing solo cleaner or team of 2. \n\nFor reference: I do hourly for first time clean then a flat rate after that. Some of the houses I have now I’ve found are tougher for 1 person - they’re also growing and learning still but I’m just trying to get ahead of the curve so I wanted to see what others had for opinions or with their experience as they’ve grown their business.\n\nThank you!",

  "text": "We have two types of staff with different responsibilities.\n* **Office managers**: They create quotes and schedule cleans, so they need access to pricing.\n* **Shift leaders**: They assign crews each day, but they should not see pricing.\n\nThe issue is that the system only seems to offer two roles: *office manager* or *cleaner*. To give shift leaders scheduling access, I have to set them as office managers. However, this makes it impossible to restrict their access to pricing. The settings for office managers are all-or-nothing: if pricing is blocked, then even the people who actually need to see it (the true office managers) can’t.\n\nHas anyone figured out a workaround? For example, can someone be set as an admin with full access while others are limited to scheduling without seeing pricing?",

We aim for 45% labor- making our hourly goal $55.56. I’ve estimated 8 hours per clean, but I’m thinking this may be overkill for the needs of the space. Even if we spent 8 hrs that would put our rate at $54.21- so the rate would be justified. \nIs my thinking of the numbers correct here?\n\nQuestion:\nDoes this seem way overpriced for Central Washington?

  "text": "# 📚Most Business Books Are Trash. Here Are the 9 That Actually Work for Cleaning Companies\n\nLook, I've probably read 100+ business books over the past 10 years of building and scaling cleaning businesses. \n\n**Most were garbage**. \n\nBut a handful literally changed everything. \n\nEveryone's posting about the latest software, AI tools, and complex systems right now. And yeah, that stuff matters eventually. But honestly? For most of us, going back to the fundamentals is the most powerful thing we can do. \n\nSometimes the biggest breakthroughs come from the basics we've forgotten or never learned properly.\n\nSince I see so many new cleaning business owners asking \"where do I even start?\", here's a real, impactful list of books that will get you further than almost any course will. \n\nNot the books that sound impressive on a shelf, but the ones that actually moved the needle when I was grinding through my first few years.\n\n**THE PRACTICAL STUFF (Read These First)**\n\n**📕Profit First - Mike Michalowicz** This should be book #1, period. Before you read anything about marketing or sales, read this. Why? \n\nBecause I see cleaning business owners hit $30K/month and still be broke because they don't understand cash flow. This book saved my ass in year 2 when I was making good money but had nothing in the bank. Set up his workflow (it takes 30 minutes and will save your business).\n\n**⏰ The 4-Hour Workweek - Tim Ferriss**\nI know, I know the title sounds like BS. But ignore that. The automation and delegation principles in here are GOLD for service businesses. This book taught me to stop being a slave to my schedule and learn how to always focus on the big wins. The key isn't working 4 hours (that's real but mostly marketing fluff), but rather teaching you how to work ON your business, not IN it.\n\n**📊 The 12 Week Year - Brian Moran** Forget annual goals, they're useless for local businesses. This book breaks everything into 12-week sprints with specific metrics. I used this for years to track customer retention, team performance, revenue per route. Game changer for staying focused and actually hitting targets instead of just hoping things work out.\n\n**💸 I Will Teach You To Be Rich - Ramit Sethi** Not sexy and comes with another stupid title, but crucial. As entrepreneurs we're great at making money, but terrible at managing it personally. This automates your personal finances so you can focus on growing the business. Set it and forget it. No book has been more impactful to my personal finances than this one. \n\n**🔧 The E-Myth - Michael Gerber** The classic, how can I not include it? Most cleaning business owners are technicians who think they're entrepreneurs. You started because you're good at cleaning, but running a business is totally different. This shows you how to build systems so the business runs without you. It's essential if you want to scale past being a one-person operation.\n\n**THE MINDSET STUFF **\n\n**💪 Antifragile - Nassim Taleb** It's a heavy read, but worth it. Our businesses get hit with constant chaos from team no-shows, to supply shortages, difficult customers, and economic downturns. This book teaches you how to get STRONGER from stress, not just survive it. It really changed how I think about preparing for problems.\n\n**🚧 The Obstacle Is The Way - Ryan Holiday** We all face the same obstacles: pricing pressure, labor shortages, demanding customers. Instead of just enduring them, Ryan's book shows you how to turn obstacles into competitive advantages. I've found this helpful in all areas of my life and is a book I gift to others.\n\n**🏆 Built to Sell - John Warrillow** This book is a treasure trove of insights, even if you never plan to sell. I've used the principles to help prep 3 different cleaning businesses for sale, and the framework completely changes how you think about building your company. It forces you to create systems that work without you, standardize everything, and focus on recurring revenue. The beauty is that a \"sellable\" business is also a profitable, scalable, less-stressful business. Essential read.\n\n**👑 Meditations - Marcus Aurelius** 2,000-year-old wisdom from a Roman Emperor that still applies to us mortals today. When your best cleaner quits via text or a customer is screaming about something ridiculous, this book keeps you centered.\n\n**Here's what I want to know from the other experienced Zenmaiders in the group:**\n\nWhich book actually changed how you run your cleaning business? Not just inspired you for a week, but made you DO something different that improved your results?\n\n**And for the newer owners:** what's your biggest challenge right now? Maybe there's a book that directly addresses it.\n\nDrop your recommendations below and let's help the newer guys n' gals out. \n\n#CleaningBusiness #BusinessBooks #Entrepreneurship #SmallBusiness #ServiceBusiness",

  "text": "What kind of call-out policy do you all have in place for your cleaners?\n\nRight now, I don’t use a point system. My team is just told to call if they need to call out. Lately though, I feel like it’s happening a little more often than I’d like.\n\nI’ve been debating a policy where if someone calls out, they automatically lose the following day too. My thought process is that if they’re truly sick, it gives them extra recovery time. And if they’re not, it creates a consequence for calling out unnecessarily. I haven’t decided if I want to implement this or go in a different direction though.\n\nMost of the time, even if someone calls out, my other cleaners can handle the day unless it’s a big job or I’ve overbooked myself. It usually only becomes a real issue if I get multiple call-outs at once.\n\nFor context, I don’t work in the field as often anymore — my main focus is managing remotely, marketing, and handling leads. So I also feel like I could work that following day if needed and I don't already have a big clean in place. \n\nCurious to hear what’s worked for you all! Do you use a point system, extra consequences, or something else entirely? Dr note requirements?",

For us, turnover is actually very low but we are also extremely picky with who we partner with. Most of the contractors we part ways with are either moving or it’s due to quality issues and even then, they often reach back out for another chance.\n\nWe’ve been in business for 7 years and the cleaners we work with have been with us for years. It truly is a partnership. There are so many people who love the cleaning side of things but don’t want to deal with the business aspects. That’s where we step in. We bring in the jobs, handle customer service, deescalations, billing, invoicing, and marketing to keep the work steady. They just focus on doing the job well.\n\nAt the end of the day, we’re all a team working together to make sure everything runs smoothly. And honestly, before I started this, I didn’t even know what a magic eraser was and to this day, I still don’t know how to use one 😅.",

  "text": "Howdy! We hit the ceiling on growth this summer (with 9 cleaners and 160 routine residences) and I've bumped up two staff into brand-new management positions.  One is now my Administrative Team Lead, who I will be teaching scheduling, billing, and performance data gathering and analysis.  The other is the Operations Team Lead who will be optimizing our training and quality control protocols eventually stepping into supervising field staff.  Both of these managers will do quality control checks and both will also clean houses when our field staff call off or quit without notice.  Offloading these tasks (which have had me working 10 hour days for 6 months at least) will free up my time to focus on strategic leadership and growth.  It's time and I'm excited.  But - I have a question for ZenMaid users in and around this phase.  Our ATL is my son and this business will be his at some point.  The OTL will need \"office manager\" access to ZenMaid, but I don't want to give this individual access to our pricing just yet.  I'd like to gauge their loyalty and discretion and other management skills before opening up that information to them. \n\nI'll send this inquiry directly to the folks at ZenMaid, but thought I'd ask here, too.  \n\nWhat advice or warnings or support might you all have?  Thanks so much for your time :)",

With that said, we were deep into the job and we all kept getting bites and finally asked one another is they noticed it.. come to find out it is extremely infested with fleas. Like something I have never seen before in my 11 yrs owning this business. It was unreal. Well the owners knew and didnt mention it... do you all charge extra for this? How much?  How would you go about it? I did not want to bring that equipment back into our work vehicle. And im worried bc I am a cat owner and dont want to bring them home. I am extremely upset that this wasn't told to us ahead of time. They knew and later told us pest control was coming WHEN WE WERE FINISHED!! they shouldve come first!",

      "text": "Hi Anna, I just wanted to jump in here and add my opinion since I think I may be able to help you. A lot of answering this question would depend on knowing how your scheduling your homes now - For example, are they used to four people or three vs two, are they all stacked with clients firm on the days they like, etc. While it is generally good advice to say you should leave the field, I don't believe this is true if: 1. Your are new at cleaning, being a business owner, or both. Unless you already know what it takes to run a team and it doesn't sound like your dead set on that even being for you, I don't see why you would leave the field. It's profitable to work for yourself, especially at the stage you're at now. Just know, that if you add even two or three more people as you make that leap, what you do for the team size you have now won't work for the team size you will have. Always be updating and plugging away and making the inside of your business better (Think SOP, Customer Acquisition, Hiring Funnels, Etc) then be adding clients and doing a good job as you go so you can maintain retention and pay the people your hiring while covering the cost of the needed extra supply. I just signed a lease for my first commercial office (been running this out of my home) and im four and half years in with 16-20 employees over the last year. But if you don't want to be a CEO, absolutely do not step away from cleaning. At least not until you know if that's what you want.",

Yesterday she even sat in the kitchen and watched my team clean.. Things keep happening in her house and I believe it's time for us to end our contract.  Her dresser has some wear, she thinks it's the products I use.. (eco friendly producrs) but I don't want to leave her stranded with this, if it is me. I want to give her a months notice at least, and then inform her I don't have the capacity to maintain her 4.5 bathroom 4 bedroom 3500SQFT house.. her floors are a pain and they are rough on my body as well.

I'm incredibly disheartened, upset, and absolutely appalled by the service we received.” This is a real, recent email from a client! Yikes 🫢\n\nIn this business, there will be complaints. And rude emails. And bad experiences. That’s why we had our podcast host, Stephanie, share this story on our recent podcast episode, where she goes through the email (which was complete with 28+ photos of poorly cleaned things in the home) and explains how she handled it.\n\nLet us know if you resonate with this or if you’ve been in a similar situation! We’d love to know more about how you handle these types of things. And if you want to listen to the episode, it’s on YouTube below (also on Spotify and Apple Music if you’re on the go):\n\n",

Can I have any pointers on how to approach the walkthrough, specific questions to ask, things to look out for? Also, if anyone has resources like checklists that they can share, I would appreciate!",

      "text": "If I added them as a lead, and marketed to them, and they want a quote to where I booked the walkthrough, I would do the following once I booked it....\n\nWithin minutes of booking it:\n\n1) I'm on Google Earth looking at the size of their space from space. I'm looking at the layout. I'm looking for shrubs or plants next to the property (cause of bugs...and spiders). I'm looking at parking to see how many could be working in there, and I'm looking at parking for our team (we're out of DC where parking is rough). I'm looking on Google Maps to see what neighbors they have we can clean. I'll plan to go door to door for them.\n\n2) I'm googling the address to pull up the LoopNet listing to grab the sqft. I'm looking at the property manager. I'm looking at lease rates. I'm looking for floor plans if available.\n\n3) I'm on the dental clinic's website and social media. I'm looking at any cleaning challenges in there. I'm looking at their vents in their pictures (dirty vents = dust issues). I'm looking at the floor types (likely LVP). \n\n4) I'm using one of my medical proposal templates to put together a rough proposal just to save time. I don't give them a proposal or a price in my walkthrough.\n\nOn the day of the walkthrough...\n\n1) I show up 5 minutes early dressed in slacks and a biz button down shirt with our logo embroidered on it (I'm a guy) and I'm carrying only my notebook w/ biz cards and maybe a brochure.\n\n2) I exchange pleasantries for 2-5 minutes.\n\n3) I ask them to show me around.\n\n4) While we're walking around I ask a dozen questions. The first one below I always ask first. Half of my questions are around their pain points. The other half are around logistics that impact my time and price in their space.\n\na) How did you find us? (assuming I don't know)\nb) What do you like best about the cleaning service you have here now?\nc) What do you like least about the cleaning service you have here now?\nd) If we could change one thing about the cleaning today, what would that one thing be?\ne) How many days per week would you like us cleaning in here? If they make a recommendation that doesn't make sense, I'll pushback (ie a 5000 sqft should be cleaned 2-3X/week at a minimum.\nf) If the space is clean and spotless, I point that out too. \"This space looks clean. Why do you want to change?\"\ng) I see in your restroom here that you have toilet paper, paper towels, hand soap, and liners. Do you need us to provide any of these items?\nh) They will give out keywords and I listen for them. For example, if they say dust 3 times, I'll stop them and bluntly say, \"This is the third time you mentioned dust. This sounds very important to you. Do I have that right?\" It means it's a hot button and responding like that shows you're actively listening. It's like a Jedi mind trick.\ni) What time in the evening can we begin cleaning in here?\nj) How soon would you want us to start cleaning?\nk) We provide our own supplies and equipment (ie a vacuum). Would you happen to have a closet or space that we can store these items?\nl) Would you happen to have any lockup procedures for us if we're selected, like alarms?\nm) You have X-ray, patient trays, patient chairs, labs areas, etc. here, Do you need us to clean these areas? (99% no, you don't).\n\n5) As I walkthrough I do chicken scratch and I also make a rough floor plan using sized squares on my paper. I'll also count fixtures in the restrooms. I only put on my notes what's different about this space compared to other locations (ie water fountain, elevator, etc.).\n\n6) Your 5000 sqft space should take 10-12 minutes to walkthrough at best. I cram in as many of these questions as I can in that short period of time. At the end of the walkthrough (and I time it as best as I can), I will then summarize what they told me in 2 minutes or less. \"If I get this right, we're cleaning here 2X per week on Tuesday and Saturday, and we can begin after 6pm. What's important to you is X, Y, and Z and blah, blah, blah, etc. \n\n7) I then give my 30 second elevator pitch. I include in that 3 things that make us different about dental practice cleaning than 99% of our competitors.\n\n8 ) I finally give them next steps and that includes confirming their email so I can send a proposal. \n\nThat's it.",

  "text": "I have a question for all you \"green cleaners\" out there. I'm currently in the planning stages of building Grassroots Cleaning , which will be a green cleaning business, and the plan is to scale over time. (As fast as possible but also not too fast. Slow and steady wins the race as they say). My first goal is to hire 10 cleaners in the first year. But I digress...\n\nI have all of my products picked out but one. DISINFECTANT!\n\nI'm having such a hard time because I LOVE my Odoban because it's:\n- ph neutral\n- a hospital grade disinfectant\n- cost effective\n\n✨️ I love all these \"features\" because it allows new employees with little training to have a \"when in doubt\" product besides dishsoap and even though hospital grade isn't necessary all the time, I like having the option. It's great for preventing mold, cleaning toilets, etc.\n\nI really can't find anything that compares. \"Homemade\" options like hydrogen peroxide are too expensive for a company looking to scale. Vinegar and Alcohol can damage surfaces. Citric acid can damage surfaces. Hypochlorous acid is also not cost-effective, and I've looked into Force of Nature, RMR, Clean Republic, and some other brands also.. But none are concentrated and again just not cost-effective. Just not realisitc for a company who's going to be cleaning (hopefully) a couple dozen houses a week.\n\nI've considered ordering HCOL (Hypocholrus acid) tablets and keeping them handy, then also buying Odoban and just being transparent with clients and giving them the option... but other than that I'm not sure what else my options could be. I've been Googling and ChatGPT-ing for days! Lol. \n\nAny suggestions?",

      "text": "Are you planning on doing any commercial cleaning? I can tell you ever since Covid. My clients probably 95% of them or more do not care about green clean and this is just my suggestion. Take it with a grain of salt but I would offer a green clean, You can even up charge a little bit to use that product line, but I would definitely not eliminate all of the other cleaners especially if you’re doing commercial.  If I owned a nightclub or a daycare where viruses were going around I would want the heavy duty stuff if you’re cleaning a restaurant after hours in the urinals are disgusting if I owned the place, I wouldn’t want someone coming in and spraying plant-based essential oils at the urinal.  Again just wanted to give you a different perspective because the truth is most people could care less they want a good clean and good sanitizing. i’m in the process of creating a product line right now which I’m gonna sell on Shopify, Amazon TikTok shop and it’s going to be about 95% plant based but I’m also putting in the stuff we need in a small amount. ￼ I actually had a friend who branded her business as fully green clean all natural products. I talked her out of it and she was so happy that I did. With that being said, you can always offer it to those few people that are saying that’s all they want.",

Long story short, the supplier that my cleaners normally get products from has recently discontinued a number of their products. Therefore, we are searching for products that can replace the ones we used to use. Can anyone share any products and/or supplier recommendations?\n\nIdeally, I'm looking for chemicals that meet the following requirements:\n1. Can be diluted to reduce cost\n2. Are green/non-toxic\n3. Can be ordered from a major distributor (Amazon or something similar is fine) \n\nI'm primarily looking for the following:\n-oven cleaner\n-all-purpose cleaner\n-mold / mildew remover for bathrooms",

  "text": "Hi guys, I have a question. I have a whole family that purchased $2000 worth of gift cards around Christmas time and unfortunately every single person that has been gifted part of that gift card money from that family has been a complete headache. It has been impossible to please them and I have never had more rude customers since having this business. My question is one of them has a $500 gift card that they are using for today’s service. She told me she had a gift card and we knew that she was going to use that but when arriving at The clean today, she told me she was going to use her sister’s gift card that couldn’t use it so she’s asking to use some of that other gift card for the balance, which would’ve been $100 cash \n\nThen she’s expecting that the other $400 from that gift card will get used by someone else in her family. I initially told her it would have been nice to know. She had two gift cards to begin with so that we could have coordinated that and she snapped and got really upset. I guess my question is is this comment to use a second gift card to cover the balance and then expect the remaining balance on that gift card to be tossed around to another house ?? ￼ or should I say that each gift card is for one household what would you do ￼￼￼￼",

      "text": "Unfortunately, this is one of those things that need to be specified ahead of time. You are going to have to stick to whatever terms you put out there initially. If you don't have it posted somewhere (website, socials) or haven't verbally expressed to them that more than one gift card can't be used per household, they will likely give you a hard time about that. Moving forward, you can at any time update policies - you live and learn and make adjustments. I would just be careful with these people if you already know they are finicky. Personally, I would just let them do it if you have not expressed to them previously that they can't or don't have it posted somewhere. I say that only because I would much rather deal with it even if I didn't want to then risk a bad review if something was not communicated up front.",

Just smile kill them with kindness and whatever they run through them. I just wouldn’t do gift cards again, anytime that I have ever done Gift cards or here in New Jersey. The schools do something called tricky trays where you can donate I did it a bunch in the beginning 100% of the time when I would do a giveaway and I would do just a three or four hour clean we would have these people acting like they won the entire lottery and we were gonna give them a full home makeover it was hilarious. I would get into it with them on the phone saying they’re gonna need more people if we are doing the refrigerator the inside of the oven and I’m letting them know we’re not gonna have time for that with one girl for three or four hours. This is a mini clean that I donated and then they’re trying to tell me that’s not what I won lol so I don’t do those anymore. \nBut if they have already paid even if it’s the sister’s gift card, I would let her use it. I don’t think about it. She will be gone soon.",

      "text": "Hi Jaime, totally my opinion residential clients do not want to sign a contract. It’s a bit much if you use Zen we have confirmation emails booking emails and appointment reminder emails that the client automatically gets you can set it up if they are a first time client they will get one in that email just have all of your Policies in the email copy paste that information and put it in your appointment reminder so they’re seeing it again mine is super detailed and has stipulations in regards to safe environments. We will not clean a home if there is excess hot or cold temperatures, animal or human waste, black mold, Drugs, family members that are following the girls around, I have about 15 of those. I also go over the pricing and the payment is due the same day, but they will probably get an invoice within the next few days if there was anything wrong or that could’ve been done different at the clean Please let us know right away so that we can remedy the situation. Things of that nature so it’s not necessarily making them sign a contract. It’s kind of just telling them. This is the way it’s gonna be if you can’t agree to this then do not book service with us in a very nice way so my clients receive this information two times before a clean if they’re regular client three times if they’re a new client, they will see it in the event. You would have to sue somebody. This is considered the contract. But for me, I’m uncomfortable with somebody presenting me an actual contract that I have to sign or some sort of terms of service where they are making it more than it needs to be.",

We’ve been told the competitive range is between $0.21–$0.23 per square foot, which seems low based on what I’ve seen in this group—especially since that includes up to 4 visits per unit.\n\nThese units won’t be overly complicated, but I’d love to hear your thoughts. Is that rate in line with what you’re seeing for similar projects? Dropping the pricing matrix in the comments for reference.\n\nAny insights or advice would be really appreciated—thanks in advance! 🙏",

They do just as many referrals to us for house cleaning so its pretty much a wash.  \n\nThere have been times where I subbed out the window cleaning formally so it is seamless service to the customer. In those cases, the window cleaning company invoices me for their bit, and I invoice the client for everything (house cleaning and window cleaning) and bury my “admin fee” for arranging the window work within my flat rate. \n\nAlso on the topic of referrals, we have a formal referral program with clients whereby if they refer someone to us and we (1) provide a quote, and, (2) we win the business, they get a referral discount on their next clean for each a quote and/or a win. 😎",

Half of mine are designed to flush out pain points (what's their biggest struggle with cleaning and why did they pick up the phone to call to begin with). And the other half are designed to solicit answers to my logistical questions (ie frequency, scope of work requests, floor scrubber use, window of time to clean, etc).\n\nI walkthrough while asking questions. At the end I summarize what they told me in 2 minutes or less. Then I give a 30 sec elevator pitch. Finally I give my next steps (ie I'll send you over a proposal...and I confirm their email). Then I go out for coffee and crunch numbers while the info is fresh in my mind.\n\nI never ever never give a price in a walkthrough. Don't sweat a price just yet.\n\nDon't say \"Zamboni\" to them for sure. Call it a floor scrubber. \n\nIf the have a floor scrubber that you sit on, like a Tennant T7, they have to have a large floor area to make it worthwhile. Those machines can run over $20K. So congrats on the opportunity. \n\nWalkthrough and soak it all in. Take a ton of notes. Then post back.",

I really feel the Lord calling me in this direction, and I don’t want to block the blessings He’s trying to send my way—or through me to others—by hesitating.\n\nI’d love to compare what I have with other examples (with ChatGPT’s help too, of course! 😅).\n\nANY advice about commercial cleaning is also more than welcome! Pricing has been the biggest hurdle I’m trying to wrap my brain around, and scheduling will be the next, though I’m planning to take that as it comes. I trust the Lord will guide the right clients—and the right cleaning techs—my way!\n\nThanks in advance for any guidance or resources you’re willing to share!",

  "text": "Hey fellow maid service owners!\n\nAs you probably know, California rolled out a big change in 2019 regarding how we classify independent contractors versus employees – it's often called the ABC test. Based on Prong B of that test, a worker is considered an employee if they're doing work that's part of our main business. For us, that means cleaning technicians would likely have to be classified as employees, since, well, cleaning is our core service!\n\nSo, I'm curious:\n\nHas anyone found a way to legally keep working with independent contractors for cleaning services, even with the ABC test? If so, how exactly did you pull that off legally?\n\nAnd for those of you who have employees, is it okay to have them provide their own cleaning supplies?\n\nAny advice or experiences would be super helpful! Thanks!",

S.B.5 (the gig worker law that mainly affected rideshare companies and delivery drivers) ended the option to have independent contractors unless they are truly independent and have their own clients. Plus, the IC sets price and can accept or reject an invitation to a job. No uniforms from your business or they'll be classified as an employee. You can have absolutely no direction in when they work, how they do it, or what they use. It does have a carve out for domestic referral agencies, but the ICs need to truly be ICs. Nobody wants to be audited by the State. They have four different agencies that can harass you. That's what I'm currently working on.",

My IRS agent told me about those ABC things so I just bend a little like if for example, your cleaners have a regular schedule every week and they are full-time that is supposed to be considered W-2 so what I do to get around that is every Thursday I ask everybody if they can please give me their schedule for the upcoming week. I always have two or three girls that need to take a certain day off so then I will rearrange the schedule that way I can turn back around until the IRS look at this. I am a website based business and I have to sub out cleaners to fulfill the service. Promise I can never have a set schedule because we don’t know exactly what we’re doing the schedules always changing so I can prove them wrong on everything basically but it’s not that serious. The other thing is you’re not supposed to give them a uniform but for me, I can show that we use the uniform for social media promoting for my website based cleaning company And if the girls wear it so that we can do filming but I’m not a typical cleaning business basically I can show a bunch of ways that I’m not a typical cleaning business I make that happen..",

I see the value of using them for new techs as they’re learning and still building their routines, but requiring every tech to use them consistently—or leaving them behind at every home—feels unnecessary in some cases.\n\nWhen I think back to my time as a cleaning tech, if my boss had required me to use a checklist, I know I’d have just checked everything off automatically without much thought, simply because I was confident in my routine. Sure, I missed things from time to time, but I don’t think a checklist would have changed that—it wouldn’t have added value for me once I knew the job.\n\nNow, if your company does more custom cleaning—where tasks vary from home to home—then I can definitely see checklists being more beneficial. Having a list in those cases would help ensure nothing gets overlooked when every house has a different set of tasks.\n\nSo for me, it really depends on the type of service model: standard vs. highly customized.",

  "text": "Hey everyone, I'm wondering if I can get some guidance on how to do cancellation policies with commercial clients. My policy says 30 days notice for account cancellations but we give a 24 hour for one time cancellations. That leaves a big loop hole open where they can cancel their account and then just automatically cancel any appointments they have left with whatever reason they want. So I'm wondering what your policy is or if you have any advice for me on how to close this loophole.\n\nBackstory: This is the first commercial client that I'm signing that I'm implementing more a professional structure. When I was solo, I got burned bad by a commercial account because I didn't have a commercially structured cancellation policy in place. Now that there are employees involved, I'm putting things in place.\n\nThanks!",

  "text": "**What would you do? **\n\nI sent a quote to a daycare for cleaning—4x per week Mon-Thurs. I priced it very fairly (honestly, might’ve underbid a little). The director replied  asking for insurance, references, and also said:\n\n              \n\n\"There are times when we're on school vacation and won't need cleaning. Is that deducted from the monthly payment?\"\n\nMy gut reaction is **no**, because the flat monthly rate already is low.. Some months would have 16 cleanings, others up to 20, all for the same price depending on how many days fall within that month. So the per-service rate shifts depending on the month —  it's around $80 per visit at 20/month, other times $100 per service at 16/month. We provide all supplies and material.    \n\nWould you offer a discount for vacation weeks? Or would you explain it's a flat monthly rate unless they skip an entire week (and even then, maybe adjust case by case)? \n\nCurious how you all handle situations like this. Thanks in advance!",

I had on my checklist faucet...but then the showers were getting clogged and were backing up so I realised I need to keep them clear. Now I know that it isnt deep cleaning, when we are doing maintenance cleaning the client is leaving the cleaning to us , and so we have to make sure these areas are kept clear. I don't need to do it every time, but I do check them every time and as soon as there is some build up I take it out with some tissue which literally takes 30seconds. One of our staff who was moving on had not touched this part of the shower for the whole time she was doing this customers cleaning despite being trained to do it and being given the correct tool to remove the cup. I went in that ensuite myself yesterday and it took me ages to sort it out because she wasn't keeping an eye on it. That was going to be a complaint in time had I not dealt with it or seen it yesterday. So as gross as it is sometimes,I have learned that its probably the most crucial part of the clean in the bathroom and when it isn't done/ maintained/checked/ the bathroom isn't being cleaned properly. We charge premium prices , so we have to do this properly. Maybe the cheaper services could say no...but we cant.",

We have 25 cleaners, 3 office staff, and get many calls...We use Nextiva and it's a mess...thinking OpenPhone but want to hear from users who have several staff. Can they route calls, have people answer from different locations, etc. And how was the transfer process?? Want to to hear good, bad, ugly before we switch.",

      "text": "Hi Marko Lazarevic,! I run a VA agency that supports a lot of start-up cleaning businesses, many from cleaning academies.\n\nMost of them use OpenPhone, even with multiple cleaners and 2–3 VAs sharing the same number across different locations. It’s been solid for call routing, shared inboxes, and remote access via mobile or desktop. The setup is smooth, and porting your number usually takes just a few days with their support.\n\nHappy to share more on how our clients are using it if that helps! 😎",

It takes 1 minute to process cards each day. I think the fee is 2.9% and maybe an additional fee per transaction. \nWe have about 280 clients and the majority have a card on file.",

You mention you want to keep fees down, but your time is being spent on how you are doing it currently and your time has value that could be used more productively elsewhere. I process all my payments for the week in about three minutes flat and my time is free to do more constructive things....but more importantly, I CONTROL the payments, I don't need to wait for clients to remember, I don't need to chase and I can easily take deposits for one off cleans.",

My girls missed stuff the day before so I had to make it right. The new hire was “cool” with the change in time until I arrived at the home we were supposed to clean and she texted me saying” it wasn’t going to work” I could’ve said “This normally doesn’t happen” but I didn’t… she wasn’t a fit😉 If you can’t adapt, it isn’t going to work.

I used my personal phone for years too and the spam calls just got out of hand 😩 Most of our clients (probably 90%) now use OpenPhone for their cleaning businesses and they love it. It’s super convenient, you can separate personal and business calls, set auto-replies, and even share access if you ever bring on a VA or team member. It's been a game-changer for a lot of them. Might be worth checking out if you're ready to make the switch! 😊",

  "text": "Im having an issue where Im having to repeat myself over and over and over, over a very simple thing with staff. Everything is given to the staff info wise to complete the job properly. They have a checklist hard copy and a copy on their phone on Google. They also have the exact job details on Google on their phone so they can access it while at the clean. We go through this over and over and over continuously on the training. Then I get staff turning up at cleans like they have no idea what's going on, cleaning things that we haven't charged for ( because they are not following the checklist)and then making us run over on the clean because they didn't stick to the plan that they had access to but didn't bother to check it. On todays clean, the staff member didn't follow her checklist OR look at the Google sheet for the specifics of the job and so I've written this up on her review as she is not meeting 'job knowledge' or 'communication' criteria. It affects her bonus. Do others have the experience of this? Its really exasperating because its so simple. Its two documents on your phone....they are there to help you, look at the job and mark it off on your checklist...simple right? Any suggestions for anything else I can do to get this through ..... because I'm at the stage where I might need to try through interpretative dance or something as I've done verbal, written, training, review criteria....Whats next to reinforce this simple yet crucial thing?  Thanks for any advice xx",

Great, right?\nThe client is adding a new primary bedroom and primary bathroom: 3bd to 4bd plus 1.5 bath to 2.5 bath.\nThe next Deep Clean will almost perfectly align with the finish of the remodel. Just to get the convo primed, I asked the client if the builder was going to arrange for a post-construction clean. (Hint:I already know the answer.) They said they would check into it.\nMy question: I know there is a pricing difference.  How do I make the case of separating the two cleans? I present a site list with the deliverables for Deep Cleans. \nAny suggestions at all?\nThank you!",

  "text": "Has anyone dealt with their spouse or partner interfering in their cleaning business?\n\nHere’s a bit of background: I’ve been cleaning solo for over 20 years. For most of that time, I only had a few regular clients and made around $400–$500/week. I kept expenses low, sometimes even using client supplies, and I’d deposit everything into our joint account. It worked fine for that season of life—my focus was raising our kids and just bringing in a little extra.\n\nNow the kids are grown, I’m 50, and my business has grown a lot. I’m bringing in $900–$1,000/week in revenue, but I’m also burning out. I want to shift from being the cleaner to being the business owner—build a team, scale properly, and separate my business finances from personal ones.\n\nHere’s the challenge: My husband is used to the old setup—low overhead, all income flowing into the joint account, and no real distinction between personal and business money. He says he supports me hiring help and growing the business, but when it comes to spending money to make that happen, he gets resistant. I think he’s struggling with the idea that more revenue doesn’t mean more available money right away. Also giving up control of what my income is being spent on. \n\nHas anyone else navigated this kind of transition with a partner who wasn’t quite on board financially or mentally?\n • Did you involve your spouse in budget or business planning to help them understand?\n • What helped shift their mindset so they could see the big picture?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would be so appreciated!",

My partner and I had a conversation that income would change when I get legit and I wanted to be legit sooner rather than later.\n\nFast forward a few months and I have a business account set up and payroll. I pay myself out $16 an hour, that way I can benefit from my personal tax breaks like the earned income credit and child tax credit. I remind my family that I’m not making the whole job in my personal account but we can benefit from the business in other ways like tax breaks. I also use my business account to cover gas expenses which saves how much I spend on my personal account.\n\nRemind him that supplies are still a low cost if you are pricing your jobs accordingly and you\nWon’t be paying for them personally, that comes from the business account.",

      "text": "Hi Anonymous,  So awesome you've made the decision to shift into being the owner rather than the cleaner.  Can I suggest you get a copy of Profit First and set up multiple bank accounts as per that system if it grabs you as being the right structure moving forward (I implemented it six months ago and it's been fabulous and rewarding and helped me to see my business far more clearly).  It might also help hubby to see the big picture, why it's necessary for things to be changing financially, where the money will be going and what it will be used for, and what the financial benefits will be.   Perhaps it's also time to clearly define or redefine what his role will be in the business, if at all, now that you're stepping up into this new chapter.  Change can bring up a lot of fear (hence the resistance), so he may need more clarity, reassurance, or just time to get used to it.  Sounds like a great opportunity to hone your conflict resolution skills, which you will definitely need as business expands 🙂  Hope this helps in some way 🙂",

  "text": "ZenMaid Tip for Fellow Cleaners! 🧼📱\n\nNot sure if everyone knows this, but you can add your Google review link into your automatic texts and emails in ZenMaid! 🙌\n\nIf you’ve been struggling to collect reviews consistently, this is a super easy way to get more traction without even thinking about it. Set it and forget it 💬✨\n\nAlso — something I just realized while reviewing my automations: wildcards (like the phone number tag) can take up more characters than just typing the number in manually. It freed up extra space to customize and personalize my messages more. Small tweak, but it made a difference! (Since your limited to so many characters for texts) \n\nJust thought I’d share in case it helps someone else out. If it gets you more reviews, that’s a win-win! 😊",

  "text": "Hello All - I've had my business for almost 5 years.  We're at $50k a month, 13 staff, 165 routines.  We have field processes set in writing and need to develop policies and procedures for the admin and sales functions.  We also need to figure out how to expand operations.  \n\nI like to think about my business as having been developed in Phases.  Phase 1 - I learned how to clean houses. I had a few helpers, and that lasted a year or so.  In Phase 2 - I learned how to find, train, and retain (ish) real employees, and how to scale up to serving clients I never even meet.  I brought on a sales person and a field \"manager\" of sorts, who helps me train and covers for folks when they call off or quit without notice.  Our sales guy can't take any more leads and my field assistant is at capacity.  It's time to go to Phase 3.\n\nPhase 3 is where the real business starts to come into existence.  Phase 3 is where I take off some of these hats and give them to people with the capacity to manage those functions for me.\n\nI am currently reading Traction, by Gino Wickman for ideas on how to get to the next level, but I feel like it's maybe written more for Phase 4 (taking that real company into real market dominance).\n\nSo, I am looking for a group on Facebook of similarly-positioned cleaning companies to network with and learn from, resources to explore and maybe some \"atta girl\" type support from folks who've made it to and through Phase 3.  TIA :)",

      "text": "Not sure if this'll help but here's how I've approached building and scaling my cleaning biz to run 90-95% without me and have people running the show.\n\nBtw, I've been in the cleaning industry for 1 year and we're at approx $20k/month. Outside of cleaning, I have a few other companies (including coaching, marketing, author) that makes multiple 7-figs a year.\n\nEveryone says to hire more people, create SOPS, use AI or automation... and those are true but most people do this in the wrong order.\n\nHiring someone new should be the last thing you do... not the first.\n\nThe first (and most important) thing you should do is familiarize yourself with all of the important KPIs that's important for your business (CPL, CAC, LTV, Gross & Net Profit %, etc). These will help you establish a baseline so that if your company starts to be ran by other people, you know the metrics to look at to see if you're still within your range.\n\nI have a scorecard template on Google I can share that takes these... just ask and I can send (idk if I can put links here).\n\nThen, once you have that together, then I have this thing that I do with all of my businesses which is something with the acronym of SEAD (systemize, eliminate, automate, then delegate).\n\nSo in that order, I start by systemizing HOW each of my business functions needs to work (marketing, fulfillment, operations, hiring, etc)... I essentially decide and define \"this is how we do things\" which will be helpful for the next person who is overseeing it.\n\nMore could be said there but that's the high level of it.\n\nThen, I go through a stage of elimination where I try to simplify the business function as much as possible. Our mktg process, our fulfillment, our hiring... what can I remove from the process without breaking it.\n\nThen, I take that same biz function and think about all of the parts of it that I can either automate or have AI aide me in. Think of things like automatically following up with leads after x days or follow up w/ past customers after 3 months for re-clean.\n\nThen, finally once I go through all of that, I find team members (my team is based in Colombia) that runs the rest of the process. I go through this SEAD thing with all of my businesses functions so that by the time I've delegated the work, i'm completely hands off.\n\nThis is a very very high level breakdown but hope it helps you think about the order to approach this next phase with... especially as you start wanting to bring more people to help you work ON the business and not just IN it.",

  "text": "So I have a situation..\nFull time employee was showing she clocked in late yesterday (by 15 mins). Didnt message me or manager to let us know and when i addressed it, she took the day to get back to me.  She called me and said she was late because she ran home to get her dog since the client she was cleaning for had asked for a play date with her dog. This employee does dog walking on the side and a lot of clients like her for this reason because she’s very great with dogs. I was very frustrated especially since I had asked this client if employee was late since employee took so long to get back to me and client said no. We have had this client since day one and I felt very irritated about the whole situation but I already addressed to both client and employee why that’s not allowed. We cannot mix business with personal and I explained why and told employee it can’t happen again. Both said they understood and were very positive about it. I’m just wondering if I am covering all my bases good enough? Am I missing something? Should I have a written warning? Should I have employee sign something? Am I overreacting? What would you do?",

      "text": "To all of the above saying it's not an issue. If you allow one employee to do whatever she wants, like bring her dog on company time, which is not something that is part of work, then you risk every employee do whatever they want. Also even though 15 minutes isn't a huge deal, she should have informed you she was going to be late and reason why,  just like you would have to in any other job. Bringing her dog to your client's home on company time is a liability to you. It is the same as bringing a kid to your clients home. She needs to stick to her job duties in a professional way. You did the right thing! Maybe you need to have a meeting with all your employees and go over your policies.",

Therefore, residential is typically charged on the higher end. We clean a medical office 1x per week and charge $85 per visit, taking us a little less then an hour to clean with 2 people. So we charge a rate of about $42.50/hour. If we were to do 5x per week, we would charge about $35/hour. Hope that helps give you an idea.",

  "text": "Regarding preparing to sell a cleaning biz… \n\nI know it’s important to have client contracts in place. However, when you define “contracts”, does this mean signed contracts that last a specific amount of time and have an expiration date, or just simple written agreements for recurring cleanings (until the client cancels)?\n\nIf I do not have binding agreements for a certain amount of time with my clients, do I only have the option to sell a “client list”?￼",

We have annual contracts and they can cancel at any time. They just want to know that the service offering is locked in, that there won't be any scope creep, and that there is a signed agreement on the price and the payment terms. I personally don't see why cleaning business owners don't do contracts. I will not buy any book of business or company if there is no signed contract. \n\nAside from that, the buyer wants to buy a business and not a job. Make sure you're not the one cleaning. I also look at the length of history with each client and the distribution of income with each client. Finally, I really look at the P&L, bank balances/cash flow statements, and the balance sheet.",

If all you have is a client list and YOUR THE ONE CLEANING, then correct, you can't sell \"business\" because what you have is a self employment job. I'm not an expert thats just what I know to be the basics. You'll need profit and loss statements, balance sheet, etc. to show investors or brokers. maybe talk to a broker and see what their advice is. goodluck!!",

Scammers usually start with a weird greeting, they have broken grammar,  they are NEVER in town to meet with you for a walk through. They need the cleaning ASAP. They will offer to send payment prior to the cleaning.  And usually will say they are writing the payment for more money because they need you to pay the movers or repair person. In the end I gave them the address for FBI fraud department, white collar division.  Lol",

The follow up email just make it very heartfelt make it go out at 7 PM at night whenever your clients are winding down. They will receive an automatic email from you. just say hi Melissa, this is Chelsea. I just wanna let you know that I’m the only one that reads these emails. I wanted to follow up with you on today’s cleaning and get your feedback with everything exactly the way that you wanted? Is there anything that we can add in or be doing differently? Your 100% satisfaction means everything to me so please let me know if there is anything that you can think of I hope that you have a great rest of your night and we look forward to your next appointment. ￼",

      "text": "After initial training, we pair new cleaners with a team lead for hands-on support—typically for 1–2 weeks, though it depends on how quickly they catch on. Once they're working solo, our quality check manager visits at the end of their cleanings to review their work, point out anything they may have missed, and teach them how to double-check their own work moving forward.\n\nMost of the time, missed details aren't due to laziness—they're just not slowing down to double-check. That’s something we drill in during training and continue to reinforce! We also do ongoing quality checks for anyone with concerns and mix in random spot-checks to keep standards high across the board.",

Something like take photos of the house when finished to ensure all the doors are locked and how did they leave ie, key under mat, garage door..\n\nI'll be utilizing zenmaid GPS clock in tracker for accuracy and if cleaners are safe and made it home..\n\nThey have access to the \"on way\" \"cleaning finished\" options.\n\nI have rented a storage unit and fully stocked the supplies and vacuum bags..  they are asked to wash their own microfibers..\n\nIs there anything else I should put in place ?\n\nI have no team leader or inspector *yet* I have printed out check lists for the team to use and leave behind, and also have instructed the team to complete a walk through final inspection together..\n\n*there was an argument over who was checking what and the one cleaner felt the other girl was criticizing her work and got defensive  *\n\nSo if there's any advice for this situation as well  is there a better way to do the inspection if I don't have an on-site supervisor or inspector.. im looking for programs or other supporting services I could receive or recommend for my team to deal with conflict in the work place.\n\nThanks for reading... signed a completely overwhelmed manager 🥲",

It’s the homeowner and my cleaners are going to be embarrassed if they didn’t get it right lol I’m not trying to sound mean or rude to you, but I would definitely not be paying somebody to go check the cleaners work when they should be nailing it every time or be prepared to be embarrassed by the homeowner not only that the follow up email that we have through Zen. Is the other inspector pretty much for me because I haven’t emailed that goes out every night at 7 PM basically saying hi at Stephanie I just wanna let you know that I’m the only one that reads this, but I would love some feedback how did your cleaning go today? Of course you don’t have to respond to thisbut if anything could’ve been done differently, I just wanna make sure that you are perfectly satisfied. Just know we can always touch up your notes. So I send them something like that so basically we’re checking that the client was happy twice. Sorry long talk to text.",

None have been a basic wipe down , shelving has had to be pulled out of the refrigerator to wash each individual tray & glass. In every cleaning so far we’ve had to scrub the tile floors and baseboards with a small scrubber, and apparently someone is sprinkling comet or ajax on sinks and tubs leaving for days before we clean. \n\nThey also ask we clean inside cabinet drawers, all of which is extremely time consuming. \n\nIs this common for move in cleaning or should we charge for deep cleaning? \n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

I’m not positive It’s like that in all parts of the country but I find in so many cases because of the language barrier sometimes it may be an issue getting certain jobs but I’m more than welcome it and will accommodate . We just use Google translator where needed And truthfully I have found so many ladies with awesome work ethic that enjoy our team environment and feel appreciated as they should and comfortable and confident being able to just speak Spanish. \n￼ I don’t speak much Spanish at all, but the Google translator is so easy so it works out really well for everybody! Highly recommend. ￼ The annoying truth is you may run into a couple clients that get snooty because they only wanna speak English with your team members, that has happened to me and I’ve straight up told them “I don’t think we’re the cleaning company for you if it’s too difficult for you to just use the Google translator, which takes one second or to just message me with any notes that you may have and I will translate.” \nAlso do a promo for your current team that if they refer a friend or family member to apply that passes training and does at least one week with the company I give  $75 referral fee. ￼",

I cant believe something this big has fell into my lap. \n\nIve done one post construction cleaning once for 1 commercial space. Which was a tiny office. It wasnt a new build,  they just remodeled the space.  The rest have been new build houses that we have done. Im hoping I dont screw this up and I win this bid. Nervous. \n\nAny and all advice is greatly appreciated. \nI got the email of what they are expecting scope of work wise. Im unable to do walkthrough. \nI also got floor plans. Materials used in the New build etc. \n\nThey want a quote for the cleaning and then a touch up cleaning quote for another day after the main cleaning is done. \n\nI wish I asked how she found me.

If so what is the best to use. Also, I am trying to insure my business and when I look up insurance here in Florida it says it won’t cover independent contractors. What is the solution to that or is there a company that will insure my clients in case a contractor breaks something?\nThank you!",

Totally up to you in regards to a background check I have been verified and to be transparent. I don’t background check every single person. I do ask them during the interview process if they’re OK with a complete criminal background do they have anything that I’ll find on the background people at that point or typically honest hey you’re gonna see this or no it’s completely clear so I do my own little online investigation. I may run them through the bin verified app if I have the time to do it I also have independent contractors, but I turn regular people into independent contractors. I’d never go looking specifically for them because that pool of people tend to have a chip on their shoulder and they want $35 an hour or more When you can just take an average person that’s applying for a cleaning job and let them know that they are now an independent contractor. Congratulations these are the guide guidelines.",

The technician utilized a microfiber cloth and Dawn soap with water in this area, which appears to have caused scratch-like marks. Despite the technician's use of only a cloth and water, she is having difficulties removing these marks and would appreciate assistance. The stove was heavily greased, so it is possible that the scratches existed prior to cleaning? The technician shared these pictures with me.",

Agents live and die on referrals, so propose a referral partnership with them. This is language they understand. They know that you will likely be one of the first people to know when one of your clients is thinking about selling. When you recommend them, and then they know anyone (clients, hairdresser, nail tech, parents at school, etc) who inquires about cleaning, they will refer you. These can be very good partnerships. Agents are usually well-known in the community and trusted as a reliable resource for many types of home services. You don't really need to incentivize it. They know the value of referrals, but you could say that for their clients, you'd do a discount of some sort, but it's not just about them referring you to their clients. If you make a good impression and refer them, they will refer you to their entire network, which goes well beyond just their clients.",

However I know bigger companies don't do that or cannot due to location/working remote and I would honestly recommend a virtual walk through as when everything is agreed at the outset the cleans are a breeze as you are all on the same page re expectations and what needs doing and its better than nothing. It also gets that relationship build that is all important...but you cant see the dirt on videos lol",

She doesn’t sugarcoat it: hiring can suck. People will flake, surprise you, frustrate you, and eventually, a few will become the backbone of your business.\n\nSo if you’ve ever said “maybe I should just go back to solo cleaning,” this will hit home.\n\nBut it’ll also remind you why it’s *worth pushing through*.\n\nWhether you’re hiring for the first time or just need to feel like someone *gets it*, this one’s for you.\n\nAmar",

Still a newer business, I could really use some input and ideas from others that are charging by the hour! \n\nWe charge $47/labor hour for maintenance/regular cleaning. \n\nDeep cleaning is $55/ labor hour.  We have a 3 hour minimum booking. \n\nNow, what about when you have a Independent Contractor that does excellent work and works very fast? She has over 10 years of experience, and  is often finished before the 3 hour minimum on a smaller /medium sized homes.       \n\nIf you have a 3 hour minimum, but it only takes your cleaners 2 hours to clean a home, do you still charge them 3 hours? Or do you allow the homeowner to give your cleaner extra tasks to do to meet those 3 hours ? \n\nI recently had a client have us Clean her Baseboards and Exterior Kitchen Cabinets to meet the 3 hour minimum that she paid for. However, those are 'Deep Clean' tasks.     \n\nHow do we differentiate when a customer books an hourly maintenance service, then expect deep cleaning tasks to be done during this time because they're paying for hourly ?  Or ... do you just charge one flat hourly rate, whether its a deep clean or regular clean, it's the same hourly rate?",

      "text": "Hi there, I can answer this for you. I only do 1099 subcontractors and I have been that way with five different locations over the last 20 years. There will definitely be people that say you have to make everybody a W-2 employee if you’re doing certain things, but that is not the case if you are running an online Cleaning business and then you’re hiring people to fulfill a service promise for your online business. There are a couple certain things that you cannot do you do need to stay in regulation. I highly recommend speaking with your local IRS agent as well as either emailing back-and-forth or doing a phone call with The labor and wages departments of your state. I have both of those people for me that I’m in contact with the only thing that they said I’m not really supposed to do is make the girls wear uniforms so I just let them wear all black because we do need to stay within branding because I’m an “online business” I have them look very branded for social media promotional things so my business does not fall into the typical cleaning company that needs W-2 so you need to make some changes. Anyways, moving along from that I charge clients hourly and I pay my cleaners hourly we also have a three hour minimum because I offered the girls a 6 to 8 hour workday. I do not pay for drive time and I do not pay for the break but they do get four dollars per gas per house so at the end of the week if they did 10 cleans, they get $40 in gas I would not want to do the deep cleaning rate and regular cleaning rate different because it would confuse me it would confuse the client there would be weird gray area where they’re trying to argue with you that it wasn’t that deep of a clean it should only be a regular so if I were you, I would switch that. Keep it easy straight across the board. The thing is if they want to add in deep cleaning duties it’s gonna take more time. So you can even add another cleaner on and charge them that way, which is what I would do with my company anything over the two girls for three hours in the home which is the most popular clean I offer I give one free hour, so I’m only 41.50 a man first time clean is always full price and then I encourage them to get on a regular schedule that we stay extremely busy but I can offer them this day and time if that would work for them and they do get the one hour for free going forward almost everybody that has first service with us will pop on the schedule which for me that’s always my goal. I wanna keep it at 10 cleaners full of regulars to where I’m only basically staying on call with everybody for changes. I do very little work now throughout the week. I have very low overhead and I love my set up. I don’t need office managers. I don’t need an office even though I have one for my other business and I kind of consider it for the cleaning business for Mail purposes, but I personally am very into not having 40 cleaners five managers because I feel like at the end of the day After paying everybody out and dealing with all that stress I would end up making the same amount that I am now I make for myself about $12-$14,000 a month. ￼ Sorry very long. Talk to text. Hope some of that information can help. I’m very open book if you would like to know anything else.",

Feeling like we’ve been stuck at the same point for the last 2-3 years and I’m looking for some fresh perspective to help us grow to the next level. We currently run teams of 2 to 3 out if an office and pay hourly. I have an assistant that helps w admin duties, training and quality. We have systems and automations in place to keep things moving but things are getting clogged somewhere and I can’t see it. So let me know who you’ve used and how they helped you. Thanks!!!!",

He wrote us our first bad review in 5 years and said we treat our employees bad. He said because we didn’t give him a lunch or compensate his travel time. We give our EMPLOYEES, gas bonuses for travel but we don’t pay them for in between clients houses. \nHe’s threatening to report us to the BBB and write more bad reviews. When he worked the working interview, it wasn’t a full day either. It was maybe 5 hours max. What are our options here and how would you handle this??",

We’d like to clarify that what you participated in was a *working interview*—a common industry practice which gives both parties a chance to determine fit before any formal employment offer is made. \n\nThe working interview was under 5 hours, and as it is not formal employment, our employee benefits and travel bonuses do not apply. Our company policy — which has kept us in good standing with our team for over 5 years — includes fair compensation, gas bonuses for employees, and respectful treatment of our staff.\n\nWe’re proud of our team culture and value feedback, but we believe this review does not accurately reflect our business practices or the positive environment we work hard to maintain. We wish you the best in your future opportunities.",

      "text": "You starting a new service added to an existing cleaning business or literally just starting a cleaning business that focuses exclusively on short-term rental cleaning? \n\nIf the latter, I would recommend reconsidering that strategy for two critical reasons.\n\n#1.  You can barely generate reviews because it's the same owner all the time, you have no connection to all the many customers that rent the unit out.  Reviews are critical for showing up higher in search and being chosen once found.\n\nThis will force you to consistently rely on direct selling and direct advertising which is harder to scale, more challenging and comes with higher customer acquisition costs.\n\n#2. If another covid happens (or anything else that impacts travel to the same degree) you'll be out of business. I would not recommend subjecting yourself to that kind of risk exposure.\n\nIf adding short-term rental cleaning to an existing business, there are some inbound marketing strategies and depending on city, there may be publicly available records of licensed addresses.  From there you can do bulk mail.",

We don't do ovens.  I've not had great success with them and asked if she would show me what she does.  I first showed her on a area, what I've been doing then client took it and did hers saying a little firmer and circular.   I wiped both areas and dried. 4 days later she emailed to say her oven door was broken and if the hinges while I was cleaning.  Now wants pmt. For new oven door.   I did not apply enough pressure to damage it.   When we closed door,  we both were standing there. She is very wealthy and of course her spouse is a very successful lawyer. She is very influential and I can envision some damage to my business reputation . Yes I carry liability insurance with a very high deductible.   I'm sick with shock. I'll have to drop her of course but what course of action do I have?",

Makes it super easy to track their time.\n\nSo to answer your question, yes you are responsible for compensating them for travel time even if they get stuck in construction traffic. If you do decide to use a time tracking app, I recommend using one that has GPS location.   That helps to ensure they are clocking in and clocking out at the right places.",

Have you had a cleaning done then?\n* How many bedrooms?\n* How many offices?\n* How many bathrooms?\n* Include inside of the oven?\n* Include inside of refrigerator?\n* Include outside of the cabinets?\n* Include top of the cabinets?\n* Do you have any pets?\n* Do you have a finished basement that you’d like to include?\n* Have you had your home professionally cleaned before? If yes, how long ago?\n\nThank you much!",

We have our own checklists which I provide of what is included in that type of cleaning. The interior of appliances are an add-on for us except for a move in/ move out(they are included).",

Luckily this doesn’t happen a lot but my point is that I couldn’t imagine guessing a price based on some questions and gambling with my profits and loss. \n\nI’m curious on how this works out for others because I’m sure that’s what a lot of people do, ??",

But meanwhile… recently my sister became my paid bookkeeper and cleaned up my QuickBooks mess and got my books humming along and presentable so I could produce an accurate balance sheet to apply for a new office/warehouse space that will accommodate me doing my laundry in-house. We got approved for the place!!! I’m going to be moving up from 2 years operating out of my house (laundry room first, then upgraded to garage). So winging it right now. 🙏 😅 Get that dirt!",

I’m 42 years old now when I was 22 I was working at a bar as a happy hour bartender, and one of my regulars was this guy that made a lot of money he would always flirt with me and tip me really well he was a high up For a popular custom home builder, and he would handle all of the trades, including cleaning crew that were handling all these cleans for the new builds in Texas. He came in one day, very frustrated and told me that I could round up 10 friends and put together a cleaning company that he would give me a contract That paid out around 200 grand for three months of work. Long story short I did it we worked seven days a week. I cried literally every day, so I got thrown into the deep end with new construction cleaning. That’s how I started out and then everybody in our business Around town and all of my customers found out that I had started a cleaning company so then I started having a team do Residential eventually stopped Commercial Cleaning and new construction because it’s stressful. Residential is a walk in the park. I only ever trained people. I’m not a great cleaner. I went on to have five locations and five different states currently now I have only my one location in New Jersey.",

  "text": "Do you operate your business on a per labor hour quote, or a per job (based on size of home, bath counts, etc) ? \n\nI have a newer business located in northern nj. Our area is overly saturated, mostly by ladies that just have a business card and a mop.  I'd like to think that we have a good website & a presence on facebook. Most prospects come through facebook, but because we're not the cheapest, we rarely get hired.  But we're also not even the most expensive, so... \n\nSo I am looking into investing in other ways into paid lead sources (FB ads, Google LSA, etc. Anything to get more business! Recommendations on this would be so helpful!) \n\nI was thinking of changing to a price per labor hour worked quote system on our website.  Does anyone here price out jobs this way and find it to be better than the pricing per job?  I'm thinking that would help with converting more customers, price shoppers would probably like this too... \n\nThoughts?",

If the cleaner gets onsite and notices home will need more time than initially estimated, they are to give details as to why, send pics to validate and an estimate of additional time needed. We will then contact customer and forward over the details and pics from cleaner and ask for approval of additional time which we would quite at an hourly rate. The cleaner would then get percentage of the additional time. We have different % payouts to cleaners based on many things- experience, reliability, reviews, tenure, etc. Hope this helps.",

  "text": "Hi All! I'm super excited to be part of this group. I found it via Stephanie's podcast (which is awesome by the way and has eased some of the questions/concerns I have about starting a cleaning company). Growing up, I have always enjoyed cleaning/organizing, and thought it was time to finally look into starting my own cleaning company. I am a huge advocate for using natural products only and will be focusing on residential cleans. I have flyers printed and am going to be passing them in the next few days so I'm excited to see where that takes me to start. \n\nQuestion for the group - What type of profit margin are you targeting with each one of your cleans? I've seen a wide range between 10% - 60% and am curious if it's all dependent on the type of clean (residential, commercial, vacation). Would love to hear everyone's thoughts.\n\nThank you! I'll have more questions to come, I just know it.",

But in general I try to shoot for 20-25% profits after my labor and overhead is paid for. Then after that I have to set aside an additional 25 percent of my profits for MY taxes before paying myself.

Also, consider picking up towels, bathmats, and washable throw rugs and placing them in the laundry as doing this will lead to a cleaner experience, overall.\n\nWe will do what we can if you do not have time to prepare your home for cleaning but note that we may not be able to complete everything on our task list if we need to spend time on these preparatory tasks. Also - if there is something in your home that is unreplaceable - either put it away in a space we do not clean or notify your cleaner to take extra care around that specific item. 412 Clean Teams is both careful and fully insured, but we know that some items' sentimental value is simply unreplaceable.\n\n Pets: Most of our clients have pets, and we love cleaning alongside them. It is very important to us that your pets remain safe while we clean. However, as we are focused on cleaning your home, we expect our clients to ensure their pets’ safety. It is our policy to clean with the exit doors closed to help prevent your pet’s escape, but we do need to enter and exit, so if your pet is a flight risk, please secure them in a safe location while we clean. Additionally, while we do not require our clients to kennel their dogs, we do require pets to be sequestered if they pose any risk to our team members or your property while we clean. \n\n Making Space: While our Cleaning Technician is working, please minimize your use of the rooms we are working in. Please also limit your use of the stove before we clean it to make sure it is cool to the touch.\n\n Payment: 412 Clean Teams uses Square, a third-party, secure, on-line credit and debit card processing service. Upon scheduling your cleaning service, an invoice will be created and emailed to the email address listed above. A link for on-line digital payments will be present in the message, and some services require a 50% deposit. Any issues with service affecting payment should be directed to us via telephone, text, or email using the contact information provided herein. \n\n Tips: Tips for your House Cleaner are not expected but are always appreciated.  The best way to tip your cleaner is with cash, given directly to your cleaner. You may, of course, simply add the tip in your regular payment for services, just know that taxes and fees will apply, and the cleaner will receive your tip less these fees in their regular paycheck.\n\n Cancellations - If you need to cancel less than 48 hours before your scheduled cleaning, a 50% late cancellation fee will apply.  This allows us to honor our promises to our staff and pay them for the time they have set aside to clean your home. We are perfectly comfortable cleaning in your absence and are prepared to mask up and clean if you or one of your household members is ill. (In that case, we would only ask that the ill person in your home sequesters themselves and wears a mask should they need to move about while we are cleaning.)  If your circumstances are such that you cannot provide for the above cancellation consideration, please give us a call.  \n\nLOCK OUT: Also note: if we cannot gain entry to your home when we arrive, we expect payment in full, regardless of whether we clean.  We send text messages prior to our arrival and will attempt to contact you if we cannot get in.  We will also wait ten minutes from your scheduled appointment before leaving.\n\nAdditional Services, Agreements, and Feedback:\n\n Additional Services - please refer to the above list of tasks we will execute at every cleaning. If you have additional rooms to clean or tasks that you would like us to execute, please call or text our office to see if additional fees apply.\n\n Agreement – by scheduling any service with 412 Clean Teams in response to this or any written Proposal made by our company, you acknowledge that you have read this Proposal and agree to all of the applicable Considerations, and that you have independently evaluated the desirability of the service and are not relying on any representation agreement, guarantee or statement other than as set forth in this Proposal. \n\n Feedback - 412 Clean Teams wants to provide the best cleaning services possible.  Please let your Cleaning Technician know if you think they are doing a good job, and/or call us if there is something that can be done better.  We appreciate you and want to be sure you're happy with our work!",

I feel like I don’t make enough money to make it worth my time unless I am on the cleans doing them. Do you guys do an hourly per cleaner or a flat rate per property?",

      "text": "You can use an hourly rate to determine your “flat rate”.  Once you know how long it takes you to clean a home think about how much you want to make per hr you’re working. It’s always good to have a floor/min you’ll go out for and also know your limits as far as size of home; do your walk throughs to avoid under charging. Find out what people pay in your area by calling around and see if it aligns with what you want to make per hr. Set your price, find clients that can pay your price, and be sure to give great service to justify your price if above market!  Hope this helps.",

  "text": "So for forever I have allowed employees to add 1 hour drive time to the day weather we drive less than hour or more then an hour a day it’s always 1 hour drive time (most the time). For the longest I have been the driver, after taking myself off the jobs the last 4 monthss and providing a work vehicle. The person who drives gets an extra 5$ added for being the driver. We are growing drastically and I can’t provide a ton of vehicle and knowninwillnhave to require people to drive there own car. How do you account for this. I need to make a change must not sure what’s fair and how to go about things. I also pay over time so allowing employees to clock in from the time they leave the office till the time they get back doesn’t seem feasible. Help!",

      "text": "I’m hitting a wall with the driving situation too, and am constantly weighing the pros and cons of doing it the way I’ve been doing it, or having a small fleet. The mileage disbursements I pay each pay period easily equal  a car payment, but I haven’t researched yet the impact of maintaining the vehicles and getting commercial insurance, etc.. I know that every week I’m spending way too much time calculating their miles from Google Maps. And now my issue is that I can’t always get them to carpool when I want, so sometimes I’ll have three dang cars showing up at the same house, which is excessive and it’s also adding to the time it takes for me to figure it out. Sometimes one of the workers will “opt out” of receiving the miles because they know it’s their choice to not share a car- I’m grateful for that. We usually work in pairs, and sometimes teams of three and four for the big deep cleans and move out cleans. We’ve had major car issues as a team. Just one employee car after another breaking down. I’ve had customers complain that their cars dripped oil in their driveway, and it’s starting to bother me more about how we are presenting ourselves to the public. It’s just sloppy sometimes. I sure am grateful that they’re willing to do it though! I’m happy to pay, I just wish it was more efficient. $.70 a mile is the going IRS business rate and I’m always keeping an eye on that.",

Those commercial clients also pay with a check as opposed to a credit/debit card. We make them pay beforehand because we got into too many times where a client would complain and decide not to pay and we just don't want to deal with that or with chasing around clients trying to get paid. With three businesses, we just don't have time to do that",

In what I have researched I saw on average most cleaning businesses offer a 30-35% pay per job percentage.\nDoes anyone in here pay per job if so, have you found it to be beneficial for you financially, and do you find that new employees are open to this form of pay?",

Soy Stephany Diaz, una orgullosa Acuariana de 35 años, nacida y criada en la vibrante ciudad de Bogotá, Colombia. Cuando no estoy explorando el mundo de los negocios, paso mi tiempo con mi inseparable compañero de cuatro patas, Apolo, mi blanco y esponjoso Pomerania de 7 años, quien, en realidad, es la verdadera estrella de mi vida.\n\nUn dato curioso sobre mí: descubrí mi talento oculto por la pintura de cuadros durante la pandemia. Lo que comenzó como un pasatiempo terminó convirtiéndose en una fuente de ingresos y en una gran pasión. Siempre he creído que la creatividad y los negocios van de la mano.\n\nEn cuanto a mi formación, soy Licenciada en Inglés, Francés y Español, con estudios adicionales en Gestión de Cuentas y Negocios. A lo largo de mi carrera, he tenido la oportunidad de trabajar en diversas industrias a nivel global, desde Petróleo y Construcción, hasta Farmacéutica y Hotelería, desempeñándome como Coordinadora de Grupos y Eventos en Hyatt Hotels. También he incursionado en el mundo de la industria de los Airbnb, y en los últimos años me he desarrollado como contratista independiente en Desarrollo de Negocios.\n\nY ahora, en 2024, inició un nuevo y emocionante capítulo en el Departamento de Marketing con ZenMaid, donde contribuyo al crecimiento de una compañía que está revolucionando la industria de los servicios de limpieza.\n\n#EventoEnEspañol #ÉxitoEnLimpieza #MujeresEmprendedoras #ClarkNJ #CapacitaciónDeLimpieza #ZenMaid #GraciasZenMaid #StephanyDiaz #ComunidadDeLimpieza",

No surfaces cleaned except in break room. They said no fridge or appliances need cleaning. I will provide most of the cleaners but they will provide rolling cart and the floor cleaner they want since it is hospital grade. Looking for a 3 night or 5 night a week quote.

If I bid on five locations at 10,000 sqft each all five prices will be different despite the exact same size. Each location has a different scope of work. Each may have different frequencies. Some clients are more pickier than others and that impacts my pricing. It may take 4 hours to clean a 10K sqft office suite but less than an hour to clean a 10,000 sqft warehouse. 10K sqft in cubicle space can take as much as 2X the time when compared to cleaning 10K sqft of enclosed offices and open floor plans. Because of these things and more, we don't standardize our pricing. We might charge $30/hr in one location but $100/hour in another for basic office cleaning.",

I watched her walk over there, and dust it again.   Then I went to recheck the lamp and it WAS STILL DUSTY. She had dusted it but missed some of the major dusty areas.   Twice.\n\nSo we talked about LOOKING at items to make sure they are clean.   \n\nWe've retrained her on dusting.  \n\nShe's had written warnings and eventually if this doesn't improve we won't be able to keep her on.\n\nAm I missing anything?",

  "text": "**[PF Cleaning Adelaide - 5 months review]**\n\nHey everyone! I thought it’d be interesting to share a bit about my journey as a small business owner.\n\nI run PF Cleaning Adelaide, with my wife helping me manage things. For a while, it was just a glorified sole-trader business, but five months ago, I decided to go all in, hiring, training, advertising, and actually scaling it into a real business.\n\n***Background Context***\nI’ve always wanted to own a local business, but I wasn’t sure what to start.\n\nI’ve worked as a marketing coordinator for nearly 7 years, so generating leads was easy. The challenge? Finding something I could learn from scratch, train others in, and eventually build into a business.\n\nI’m not a plumber, electrician, carpenter, detailer, or dog groomer, so those were out. But back when I lived in Brazil, I made a decision: when I moved to Australia, I would work as a cleaner.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what I did. Once I arrived, I landed a cleaning job and… turns out, I LOVE CLEANING!\n\nI don’t know what’s wrong with me ahaha I genuinely enjoy it!\n\nAnyway, I thought hiring people would be easy. I was so wrong.\n\nAustralia is facing a massive labor shortage, with fewer immigrants and students coming in. On top of that, most people don’t actually like cleaning, it’s just a job they accept because they need to pay the bills.\n\nMy biggest pain point has been finding decent teams to allow growth.\n\nPlease consider I will use Australian Dolars instead of USD. 😊\n\n***A quick snapshot of my current status***\n25 jobs per week, approx $3913 per week, 7 cleaning teams, 37 new leads per week, 13 reviews on google, 4.8 stars average\n\n***Investments***\nCurrently spending $150 per week on ADS, $120-$200 per week on a part time assistant, $90 per month on software, insurance, hosting etc.. Nothing fancy.\n\nI still can't make a living of the cleaning business, so I still work as a part-time marketing coordinator.\n\n***Goals***\nMy current goals are to reach 40 jobs per week.\n\nIt’s been a wild five months, I have almost quit two times, and I’m excited to see where this goes. Thanks for reading!\n\nif you’ve got any questions (or hiring tips 😂), drop them in the comments!",

This will give you a better idea of the fair market value and help you adjust your prices accordingly.\n\nIt's also important to factor in paying your cleaning techs a good living wage. Pricing your services correctly not only ensures your business remains profitable but also helps you attract and retain quality employees.\n\nWhen we adjust our prices, we always send an email to our clients informing them of the change. Typically, we provide at least 2 weeks notice before the new rate takes effect.",

  "text": "Hi team! How would you handle the issue of cleaners not properly reading the notes or checklist of the jobs?\n\nContext: I had a few complaints regarding missed spots from some customers.\n\nThen, I decided to implement a test with the cleaner that had these complaints. I added 2 very silly requests to the customer notes. \n\nTo pass the test, the cleaner had to either ask \"is this correct?\", or do the task anyway without asking. The cleaned failed both.\n\nNow I am sure this cleaner is not reading the notes, and I need to deal with it in a way that fixes the issue. How would you do that? What exactly would you say?\n\nThanks!",

It’s not overwhelming and safe to use on just about everything so makes it more bullet proof for the cleaners. However you do have to dilute it much more for glass which we can never get it to be perfect on so we use another cleaner. \n\nHowever since you can dilute it down it goes a long way on your bottom dollar. Overall it’s a win for us and cheaper to buy it from a chemical store if you have one near you compared to online.",

  "text": "How would you sort this problem? IT question! \nWe are a residential cleaning company of about 80 cleaners, 5 office staff and 5 VAs. All the office staff and VAs access the same email, and we assign Gmail  emails via labels to our VAs. We delegate our main inbox so the VAs have access to the e-mails, however, this isn't  a perfect solution. \n\nThe main issue lies in VAs not having access to our Google Tasks that our office uses every day to prioritise the most urgent tasks. \n\nExample:\nIf 3 clients cancelled with a short notice after hours, we usually attach these emails to Google tasks with a clear instructions on what to do in the morning rush next day, without loosing time to interpret long emails, as time is limited if you need to instruct cleaner to start driving to a different job or swap some jobs. We always attach email there as a reference. \n\nThe problem is, if we use any other software for daily tasks like this, and our VAs will be able to use it, we cannot attach emails. \n\nHow would you sort it? The volume of emails and events daily is huge, so we are looking for the most efficient and safe solution.",

It would be the first for me to hire a male but I'm contemplating on giving it a try. For those of you who hire male cleaners what are your thoughts on customer reactions? Do you have the males working solo, in a team? Separately or together with a female cleaner if they are in a team. It is scary for me to give it a try, but good  female cleaners are very hard to come by in my area. Any feedback much appreciated!",

  "text": "We seem to be dealing with one of these situations almost every week now. A client claims their home is 5/10, but in reality, it’s an 8-10/10—pests, biohazards, pet urine/feces, and heavy cluttered surfaces.\n\n**Our intake process is thorough: **my sales manager reviews the home's condition with customer with a series of very pointed questions by phone, makes it crystal clear that we cannot clean under the conditions above, and takes a** 50% non-refundable deposit** to ensure commitment. We explain that if any of the above conditions are present, we cannot perform service and **THEY WILL BE CHARGED IN FULL** to compensate our teams for time, travel, and lost wages. We state this on a recorded call, then reinforce it with three emails and a text confirming our policies before service. Despite all this, people keep lying about their home’s condition. \n\nRight now, I have one who has filed a BBB complaint, is disputing the charge on Stripe, and is threatening legal action and media involvement. Another just came in today—same story. The client claimed it was a 5/10, but the urine and feces smell was so  overwhelming that my team had to leave (photos attached). \n\nHave you dealt with this kind of issue before? Any advice on how to minimize disputes or handle them more effectively when they arise?\n\nAppreciate any insight you can share!",

Considering scrub pants and a company shirt. Do you give uniform reimbursement? How much? \n\nCan you show me what your team wears. Or share some photos for head shots or branding ? So I can see 😁",

We now order iron on labels online through Ninja Transfers and use a Cricut machine to press them on.  Our team likes the stretchy part of the tops. Make sure to get some with spandex/lycra if you got the scrub route.",

The referrals have stayed consistent and it’s a great networking opportunity to find leads of all kinds. \n\nI recently paid to be on the cover of our local town magazine and I’ve had over 30 leads in less than 48 hours. It’s proven to be the best advertisement I’ve done yet. I never imagined that people paid that much attention to magazines, but apparently they do! \n\nI went door-to-door recently and handed out brochures for our company and didn’t have a single lead. Someone did tell me though you have to be like a mosquito and continue to come back to bite 😂 so they may not book the first time they hear your name but maybe the third or fourth time they will remember & contact you. \n\nHope this helps!",

I have a few questions and would appreciate any insights or experiences you might be able to share:\n\nHas anyone transitioned from a storage unit to a reimbursement system for employee supplies? If so, how was the process managed?\n\nWhat criteria do you use to determine which supplies are eligible for reimbursement? Are there specific categories or limits on amounts?\n\nHow do you handle the approval and reimbursement process? Are there specific tools or software that have proven helpful in streamlining this?\n\nHow do you ensure compliance and prevent misuse while maintaining efficiency in processing reimbursements?\n\nAre there any challenges you didn't anticipate when shifting to a reimbursement model?\n\nHow do you track and record these reimbursements for accounting and tax purposes?",

      "text": "I also wanted to share the legal advice I was given from my business lawyer recently regarding this very situation. :) \n\nThis will be lengthy, but worth the read! \n\nThere are a couple of things that you need to be aware of.  OSHA requires employers to pay for a provide personal protection equipment (PPE). Examples of PPE include hard hats, gloves, goggles, safety shoes, safety glasses, welding helmets and goggles, face shields, chemical protective equipment and fall protection equipment.  For your purposes, I could see that gloves may be necessary since your employees are using chemicals.\n\n \n\nAs to employees buying their own supplies or equipment, The US Dept of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Fact Sheet #16, prohibits employers from requiring employees to pay for tools or supplies that are considered to be for the benefit of the convenience of the employer if by doing so would reduce their wages below required minimum wage or overtime compensation.  Cleaning supplies and equipment would fall into that category.  The example given is that is being paid minimum wage of $7.25, an employer may not take any deduction for the wages for the cost of a uniform nor may the employer require the employee to purchase the uniform on his/her own. However, if the employee were paid $7.75 per hour and worked 30 hours in the workweek, the maximum amount the employer could legally deduct from the employee's wages would be $15.00 ($.50 X 30 hours).  An employer may prorate deductions for the cost of the uniform over a period of paydays provided the prorated deductions do not reduce the employee's wages below the required minimum wage or overtime compensation in any work week.\n\n \n\nAs it applies to supplies, the DOL has stated that the cost of any items which are considered primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer would have the same restrictions as apply to reimbursement for uniforms. In other words, no deduction may be made from an employee's wages which would reduce the employee's earnings below the required minimum wage or overtime compensation.  Some examples of items considered to be for the benefit or convenience of the employer are tools used in the employee's work, damages to the employer's property by the employee or any other individuals, financial losses due to clients/customers not paying bills, and theft of the employer's property by the employee or other individuals (this is good to know given the employee we believe was taking supplies). Employees may not be required to pay for any of the cost of such items if, by so doing, their wages would be reduced below the required minimum wage or overtime compensation. This is true even if an economic loss suffered by the employer is due to the employee's negligence.  The fact that is says any indicates that it is all or nothing.\n\n \n\nIf an employer requires a minimum-wage employee to provide his own “tools” for work, the employer must reimburse him for 100% of the cost of doing so.  I know you pay more than minimum wage but am not sure where this leaves you.  If you paid an employee $15 an hour and they work 30 hours a week, they are earning $232.50 more a week than minimum wage would provide which I would think would cover most things. But, if you have an employee that only works 10 hours a week, they earn $77.50 more than minimum wage, which would cause a problem if they need say a vacuum.",

      "text": "Here you go Larissa Kleemola\n\nWhat to Include in Customer Guidelines\n\nWelcome/Intro - In this intro paragraph, you’ll simply thank them for choosing your company and welcome them.\n\nHow To Prepare for Cleaning - Let your customers know what they can do to prepare for cleaning \n\nParking (for city services) - What is the parking situation? Will you be charged for parking, and will you pass that fee along to your client?\n\nEntry Information - Outline your policy on gaining entry to the home. \n\nEmployee Info - Let them know your employees are trained if they are bonded, background checked, etc. State in this section if they can rely on the same cleaner each visit or if having the same cleaner is not a guarantee.\n\nArrival Info - Outline how your arrivals work. Most owners let their clients know the cleaner(s) will be there within 30 minutes to an hour of the appointment time on their reminder notice.\n\nThings Your Company Does Not Clean - Be specific in listing out things your company does not do during a cleaning. For example, most companies do not clean pet feces, wash walls, hand wipe chandeliers, clean up after excessive bodily fluids (outside what you run across in a normal bathroom cleaning), empty shredder trash without permission, empty diaper pails, etc. This is also a good time to let them know your policy on items being moved for cleaning.\n\nPayment Requirements - Make sure your guidelines state your payment requirements. You need to let the customer know what forms of payment you expect and when payment is expected. If you keep a card on file, make sure to let them know when the card will be run for each appointment.\n\nTipping - Including a short statement such as “Tips are not expected but appreciated” is a good way to let your customers know it’s okay to tip.\n\nLock Outs and Cancellations Policy - This is an absolute must in this industry. Be very clear on what your fees for lockouts and cancellations are. Include a timeframe for when a cancelation incurs a fee.\n\nGuarantees and/or Refunds - Be sure your clients are aware of any guarantee you offer and if you offer refunds or not. If you do not offer refunds, be sure that is stated in your guidelines.\n\nPrice Increases/Adjustments - If you plan on regularly, or as needed, increasing your prices, then make sure your clients know this is a possibility.\n\nPet Safety - Outline the policy for pets. Most of the time, pets are a wonderful part of the work we do, but if they are skittish or aggressive, make sure your policy makes your client aware it is their responsibility to secure animals.\n\nValuables - If you work in a lot of high-end homes with a lot of high-end valuables laying about, you may want to write a policy in your guidelines that informs your customer that it is their responsibility to remove anything that cannot be easily replaced or they do not want to be damaged accidentally. Include your policy for making them aware of any damages/breakages during cleaning appointments.\n\nClimate Control - Make sure you have a clear policy on thermostat settings during super hot and super cold months. \n\nSafety - State any safety policies for the home or crew that the client may need to be made aware of.\n\nQuality - Explain how quality is maintained/managed.\n\nWaivers - Include waivers for things like using their vacuum or any supplies and equipment they provide for the cleaning.",

One for commercial, one for post-construction, one for residential. It would be extremely difficult efficient to have the capability to “select your service” and then the appropriate form pops up. Is this already a thing or how can I do this?",

  "text": "Hi! I’m a new business owner, pretty tach savvy and I’m SO HAPPY with Zenmaid. It hadn’t occurred to me to profit share with cleaners but when I saw it on Zenmaid I was like THIS MAKES SENSE. \n\nAnyways, before I do my hiring I was wondering what a good revenue share is with our cleaners? \n\nBackground is they will be subcontracted, have their own personal liability insurance and cleaning supplies. This is pretty standard in my city. \n\nOur minimum booking is $140. We charge $12 per 100 sq ft + $12 for every full bathroom. This is for a standard clean. Discounts on recurring services and extra charges for move in/move out, deep cleaning or other ad ons.\n\nSO, what do you guys think? I was kind of thinking starting at 50% and if they are great and keep the client happy move them up to a higher percentage. Also, $20 for each Google review. \n\nI’ve been a cleaner so I personally think this is cool. Minimum $70 for the cleaner even on a small 2-3hr job and opportunity for more but I still want opinions just in case I’m too high or low! \n\nTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE! 🙂",

Automatically, and maybe you don’t even care about that information, but you’re going to pay double to use it. Or triple 😳\nThere is a software that some of my local colleagues tout that is ~thousands~ of dollars a month. That’s insane to me.\nI love the customization of the booking forms. You can put them in your company colors and you can make them do anything from auto scheduling to a lead form. \nA clean and clear dashboard to give you a straightforward glance at all of your numbers.\nWanna run payroll? Cool. ZenMaid will do the legwork for you (other than literally paying it) guess what? It’s part of your pricing. \nWant to lead nurture? ZenMaid does it. \nCustom company checklists right in the app.\nGPS clock in.\nEasy to read calendar leading to faster sales conversions by zipcode. \nI could literally go on and on. 😂",

  "text": "This is probably more of an accounting question but for other business owners. How do you run your payroll cycles?\n\nFor example, I run payroll semi monthly. I always thought (for proper accounting) what was worked the 1st-15th gets processed on the 15th, and 16th through last day of the month gets processed last day.\n\nHowever, pay isn’t deposited into my employees account for 2-3 days after processing. How does someone make payroll post on the day. Are you behind a pay cycle to process it 2-3 days beforehand? \n\nHope that makes sense, I’m trying to find a better system so I can say payday is 15th and last day of the month and employees are paid ON those days.\n\nThank you!",

While this takes some initial effort, it ultimately allows for smoother scheduling and reduced driving time between cleanings.\n\nOnce the schedule is set, I use MapQuest or Google Maps to create optimized routes, helping to forecast mileage costs this was the most cost-effective for us.",

Does it hurt us to list a secondary business address under our current Google listing? \n\nAlso, it looks like it would require its own phone number. Does anyone in here operate with more than one number? \n\nThanks in advance for your helpful insight!",

You can easily add a second line with a VOIP provider and auto forward to the same number if needed.\n\nYou also can no longer link the GBPs to your home page.\n\nNo two GBPs should ever link to the same URL.\n\nLots of other stuff involved but again, way too much to type.\n\nYou're anonymous so maybe you might not be open to it, but you're welcome to come on to our live podcast to get all your questions answered that should be far more valuable to you than any reason you'd have to remain anonymous.\n\nThe impact to your bottom line plus the saving of tons of money by avoiding bad advice that could penalize you should be worth it.\n\nWe'd also link to your website from our channel for added promotional value.\n\nLet me know if interested or at least be willing to privately share your concerns as to why you prefer to be anonymous because it's such a great question and the insights can be valuable to business owners all over the world.",

Should I stick with commercial work or diversify into residential cleaning? I'd love to hear your thoughts.\"",

  "text": "We have an ex employee who we fired several months ago. There were 3 different occasions that we lost clients due to things gone messing from medication to necklaces and so forth. We have different pieces of evidence such ss texts confirming she was asking other employee about pain killers.\n\nThe only other person on cleans with her was our lead trainer. The rooms things went missing in were areas this ex employee cleaned and not our lead anyway.\nwe received a message from her today:\n\n“I spoke with my Lawyer after I was let go without probable cause. I would like to talk to you about that as well. My Lawyer would like to speak with you about some things. Thank you have a good day.”\n\nWe did not fire our lead and she is trying to threaten us with an attorney. MO is an “at will” state and we do not have to give reason. We did explain to her why we were letting her go when we did at the time, but she is claiming otherwise. We were likely not even going to respond. If we do we can definitely provide evidence for our reasons why we let her go, but I am busy I dont have time. Thoughts?",

I started playing with and love it but would love to know if there are plans to make it so that once the job is marked complete the checklist can be emailed as a PDF or something to the client. \n\nMany of us leave the checklist for the client with notes and even QR codes for tipping or leaving a review. If I use this checklist feature, my techs would have to mark things off twice. \n\nThe easy solution would make it so that whatever was checked off would be rolled up into a PDF and emailed to the client. This alleviating the need for any paper or any double work.",
